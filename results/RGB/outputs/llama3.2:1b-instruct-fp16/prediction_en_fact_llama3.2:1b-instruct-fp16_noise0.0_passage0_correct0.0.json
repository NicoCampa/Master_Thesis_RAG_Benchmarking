The company went public in 2010 and has since become one of the largest and most successful EV manufacturers in the world.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Tesla's financial performance varies from quarter to quarter and year to year.

The company also reported net income of $409 million in the third quarter of 2018, which was a 30% increase from the same period in 2017.\n\nWhile I couldn't find any information on Tesla's revenue figures for Q3 2019 specifically, it's likely that the company continued to experience significant growth during this period.
