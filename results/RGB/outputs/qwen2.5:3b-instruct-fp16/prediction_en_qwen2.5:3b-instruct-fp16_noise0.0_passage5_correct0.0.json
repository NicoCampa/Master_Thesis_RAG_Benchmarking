Here’s how it works. Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush – in her first turn playing a doctor on TV – takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery… with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.  The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob “Griff” Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff’s lead rather than Sam’s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?", "By Monique Jones, Common Sense Media Reviewer               Common Sense Media Reviewers       Common Sense Media reviewers include writers, editors, and child development experts.

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.", "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.  RELATED: 10 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey’s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam’s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed “dysfunctional family dramas”.  ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Key also wants to make sure his players don’t believe winning is easy after doing it twice in a row.

It had nothing to do with Semore; it was the nickname of an assistant who had just left the team. “It was probably because he didn’t remember my name,” Semore said. “It was right when I got hired, and then everybody started calling me that.” His job at Oklahoma State also connected him with Andrew Thacker, then a GA. Thacker helped bring him to Temple in 2018 as a defensive analyst, and Collins brought him to Tech for a similar position that he held before taking a defensive coordinator job at Division II Valdosta State.

Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII.", "When the Super Bowl is played Feb. 13 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, it will mark the first time in nearly 30 years that the game returns to its roots in Los Angeles. Starting with Super Bowl I in 1967, the game has been played seven times in the Los Angeles area, all at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and LA Memorial Coliseum south of downtown LA.  Below, we have a look at those seven Southern California Super Bowls and memorable, sometimes bizarre, moments from each game, halftime shows, national anthem performers and more.  The 2022 Super Bowl is Sunday, Feb. 13. It will air live on NBC and the streaming service Peacock. The broadcast will begin at 3 p.m. PT, with a kickoff time set for 3:30 p.m. The first Super Bowl bears little resemblance to the days-long cultural and sporting event we know now. About 62,000 people attended the game at the historic home of the USC Trojans and two Summer Olympics. That's the smallest attendance figure of any Super Bowl, illustrating the difference between the first game -- which also was broadcast by two TV networks -- and today's mega-event.   The game was actually called the American Football League (AFL)-National Football League (NFL) Championship Game.", "The Super Bowl is going to be held indoors for a little while. After last year's contest in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the Super Bowl heads out west to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, for Super Bowl 56. From then on, the Super Bowl will continue to be held in dome stadiums for a while. Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973). Pasadena also hosted the Super Bowl five times (1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993) in the Rose Bowl.", "Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl with a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]  The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since winning 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis.

Twitter and Facebook banned the former president following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol.

Amid concerns about its effect on competition in the industry — particularly in the nascent cloud gaming market — and in the face of ardent lobbying against the deal by competitor Sony, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority first decided to block the acquisition, then agreed to further talks with Microsoft and Activision. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its attempt block the deal legally after a federal judge ruled in favor of Microsoft being allowed to close the deal. The European Union, meanwhile, has given the deal its seal of approval. Here’s the latest on Microsoft’s plans to snap up Activision Blizzard. According to Reuters and Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its administrative case against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was due to go before an in-house judge in August. Microsoft and Activision had requested the case be withdrawn after the FTC lost its case arguing for a block on the deal in district court, and was denied an extension of a temporary block by an appeals court. The move means Microsoft and Activision can now try to persuade the U.S. antitrust regulator to accept a settlement.", "Tech giant Microsoft made headlines in early 2022 by announcing its intention to buy Activision Blizzard, one of the world’s most-valuable gaming companies, for $68.7bn (~£50.5bn). The news took the world by storm, and was quickly labelled one of the most influential deals in the history of gaming. Yet it’s July 2023, and the two companies are still separate due to a number of legal hurdles, lawsuits and inquiries from governments all around the world.  The merger may still go ahead, but no one truly knows if or when. The original deadline for the merger to complete was July 18th, however this has now been extended. We’ve compiled a recap to keep you abreast of the Activision Blizzard deal’s trials and tribulations. Due to the scale of the deal, regulators around the world fear that this acquisition may hurt competition and give Microsoft — which already owns Xbox — too much power in the gaming market. Fears have centred around the potential effect on market share in the console gaming market. Microsoft could, regulators argue, make Activision Blizzard’s games (including the ultra-successful Call of Duty franchise) exclusive to its consoles, thereby hurting competition with rivals Sony and Nintendo. Other concerns have been around the potential impact on market share in the growing cloud gaming market.", "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.

The outward cameras on the headsets will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work wirelessly and doesn’t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year’s announced Pixel 6 smartphone.  This Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of “ski goggles” with cameras on them which doesn’t require external power.

The report noted that the 2024 window isn’t set in stone and the device could launch later. As for what Project Iris can actually do, details are scarce for the moment. Google is apparently developing Iris in a building that requires special access privileges just to get inside.

The report cites two people “familiar with the project”, and claims that the target launch date for these glasses is 2024. There are no visuals accompanying this information, so we’ll have to use our imagination a little. While Google Glass looked like a Saiyan scouter designed by someone who can see Table Mountain from their office, these will be more like ski goggles in terms of design.

Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.", "Meta is building a new supercomputer to train enormous machine learning algorithms. Though only partially complete, the AI Research Supercluster (RSC) already ranks among the most powerful machines on the planet. When it’s finished, the company formerly known as Facebook says it will be the fastest AI supercomputer anywhere. Meta hopes RSC can improve their products by training algorithms that better surface harmful content. Further out, the company says advances might enable real-time language translation between tens of thousands of people online and multitasking algorithms that can learn from and generalize across different inputs, including text, images, and video. All this, the company said, will help advance real-world applications like robotics and, of course, build the foundations of the (as yet primordial) metaverse. “In the metaverse, it’s one hundred percent of the time a 3D multi-sensorial experience, and you need to create artificial-intelligence agents in that environment that are relevant to you,” Jerome Pesenti, Meta’s VP of AI, told the Wall Street Journal this week. Whatever the ultimate applications, the investment shows tech’s biggest players—from Meta to Alphabet and Microsoft—deem it increasingly crucial to be competitive in cutting-edge AI.

The company said that this will be the fastest supercomputer in the world once fully built by mid-2022. The device is said to accelerate AI research and help in building the metaverse, the next major computing platform. A supercomputer can perform high-level processing at a faster rate when compared to a normal computer. Supercomputers are made up of hundreds or thousands of powerful machines which use better artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve operations that process huge amounts of data in less time than normal computers. They work together to perform complex operations that are not possible with normal computing systems, Sanjay Gupta, Vice President, and India Managing Director, NXP India, a global semiconductor company said to The Hindu. Supercomputers require high-speed and specialised chip architectures.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads.

But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC).

Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.", "40] Playtesting was facilitated by Bandai Namco, which in November 2021 initially released the game as a closed beta that players could sign up to test.[41] The game's full release was scheduled for January 21, 2022, but was postponed to February 25 the same year.[42][43] Elden Ring had performance issues at launch; players complained of an insufficient frame rate.[44][45] Bandai Namco addressed some of these problems through software patches and updates.[46][47]  A crowdfunding campaign for an Elden Ring-based board game by Steamforged Games was launched on Kickstarter in November 2022.[48] In February 2023, an expansion called Shadow of the Erdtree was announced  for release at a later date.[49]  Elden Ring received \"universal acclaim\" according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[50][51][52] On video-sharing platform Twitch, it drew nearly 900,000 viewers within 24 hours of release, making it the third-most-popular debut on the platform after Lost Ark and Cyberpunk 2077.[68]  The game's open-world setting received acclaim; reviewers praised the exploration mechanics.

And this symbolises the blessing or the grace of the Erdtree. However, after a time, there were some individuals who lost this grace, and the light faded from their eyes. And these are what are known as the Tarnished.” The Tarnished were banished and exiled from the game’s world many years prior to when you – the player – will enter it.

This film directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, from a story by Seth Gordon, features Loretta Sage, a brilliant author who writes romance novels set in exotic locations featuring Dr. Angela Lovemore and her romantic interest, Dash McMahon. But Loretta's real life bears no resemblance to the things she writes: after her husband's death, she became a reclusive, grumpy woman who is not even eager to write anymore. Halfway through a promotional tour for her latest novel, Loretta is kidnapped by a lunatic billionaire who wants her to lead him to a lost city treasure she depicted in her book. Fortunately, Loretta won't be alone: Alan, the cover model of her books, sets out on a journey to rescue her and demonstrate that he can also be a hero. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum headline this blockbuster alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Brad Pitt, and Oscar Nunez, among other actors. The Lost City was released in March 2022 and quickly became a box office hit."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

By Julia Jacobs Nearly a year after Will Smith slapped him onstage at the Oscars, Chris Rock joked about the explosive moment on a live Netflix show Saturday night, using the last few minutes to mock Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Now I watch ‘Emancipation,’ just to see him get whooped,” Rock said, referencing last year’s Civil War-era drama in which Smith plays an enslaved man who is forced to labor for the Confederacy. In the days after Smith stunned the world with the slap, Rock, a comedian not known to shy away from controversy, was expected to quickly make his feelings about the episode known. Instead, he said at his first show after the Oscars that he was still processing what had happened, and he assured fans that there would be a time and place for him to discuss it in depth. That time and place turned out to be Saturday, at the Hippodrome Theater in Baltimore, in a stand-up show that was live-streamed for the rest of the world. At times, Rock made himself the target of his own jokes, noting Smith’s larger build. “Will Smith does movies with his shirt off,” said Rock, pacing the stage in his white outfit. “You never seen me do a movie with my shirt off.", "It was one of the most infamous moments in Academy Awards history that became known as \"the slap.\" The world could not stop talking about Will Smith striking comedian Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.  A lot has happened since the slap: Will Smith apologized (twice) and was banned from Academy events for 10 years. Chris Rock finally addressed the incident in-depth during a live comedy special, nearly a year after it happened. And the 2023 Oscars went down without any slaps – though the moment was certainly a talker during the show. Here's everything to know about the slap and everything that's happened since. The controversy began when Rock appeared onstage to present the Academy Award for best documentary feature during the 2022 Oscars ceremony. In his introduction, Rock made a joke about a possible \"G.I. Jane\" sequel in reference to Pinkett Smith's bald head. Smith appeared to first laugh at Rock's joke, though Pinkett Smith rolled her eyes and looked upset. Afterward, Smith walked up to the stage, slapped Rock and returned to his seat amid confusion in the crowd about whether the segment was scripted or real.  \"Will Smith just slapped the (expletive) out of me,\" Rock deadpanned to the audience.", "Filed under: What the American Oscars telecast cut from the Will Smith-Chris Rock confrontation. Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith. In 1997, he had commented on her participation in the Million Woman March in an interview on his late night-talk show, The Chris Rock Show."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Advertisement So for new Hokies head coach Brent Pry, chief among his tasks is to be open and honest with players about where they fit in the new world order, what their role is and, in some cases, whether he thinks they’re good enough to play at Virginia Tech. “We can’t be afraid of hard conversations,” Pry said. “Everybody in here has weaknesses, including myself. It’s about staring at those head-on and addressing them and let’s go work through them and strengthen them.” In that spirit, here’s a hard conversation for Hokies fans: This season could be a rough one. That’s not a commentary on Pry’s long-term viability as Tech’s coach. The early returns seem positive, with Pry saying and doing all the right things and sowing the seeds with how he and his staff are re-establishing themselves in the state on the recruiting trail after many of those relationships atrophied in the Justin Fuente era. But this roster isn’t in a quick-fix situation.", "Virginia Tech football coach Brent Pry and former coach Frank Beamer discuss the program's past and future. (6:18) Virginia Tech coach Brent Pry inherited a program in 2022 that had lost its way, more than a decade removed from its last conference championship. Though Pry had zero head-coaching experience, he had spent the previous eight years at Penn State, coaching and recruiting in the Big Ten. Perhaps most importantly, he was the candidate with the most extensive ties to Blacksburg and legendary coach Frank Beamer. When Pry was introduced as head coach, athletic director Whit Babcock proclaimed, \"It's nice to see this place reunited.\" Then Pry went 3-8, giving Virginia Tech its worst season in 30 years. Though Pry remains optimistic about the future -- \"I'm the right guy for this place, and this place is right for me\" -- one major question persists: Can Virginia Tech still compete at the highest level of college football? Beamer took Virginia Tech to unprecedented heights -- six BCS games, including one national championship game appearance, and a string of eight consecutive 10-win seasons from 2004 to 2011. His successor, Justin Fuente, won 10 games in his first year, then went 33-27 over the next five amid what sources described as a \"dysfunctional\" relationship with the administration.", "May 17, 2022 ...

However, it's important to note that this high-resolution mode can only be used when taking images in ProRAW mode; otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting at 12 megapixels for improved low light performance and faster image processing.", "docs": ["iPhone 14 Pro models feature an upgraded rear camera system that can shoot 48-megapixel photos, but only in ProRAW mode. This article explains what ProRAW is and how to enable it. Apple's biggest camera upgrade for the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max models is to the Main lens, which has been increased to 48 megapixels.  Apple says the new sensor also comes with a \"new machine learning model [that] delivers sharper images and less noise for unprecedented detail.\" However, this only applies when taking ProRAW shots at 48 megapixels. Otherwise, the camera defaults to shooting in 12-megapixel resolution, similar to iPhone 13 models.  There's a good reason for this. ProRAW is a 10-bit file that uses the Linear DNG format to retain more information and dynamic range, providing additional flexibility when editing exposure and white balance. With a ProRAW image containing 8,064 x 6,048 pixels, these files consume a significant amount of storage and can be approximately 75MB in size, or three times the size of an average 12-megapixel image.  Unless you have the largest capacity 1TB ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ model, you're unlikely to want to shoot at this resolution all the time.", "This year's iPhone will likely be a bit more stratified than usual. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that Apple's iPhone 14 Pro will get a massive camera update, with the phone's main (wide) sensor being bumped up to 48-megapixels. If accurate, this would be one of the biggest upgrades Apple has made to the iPhone, which has had a 12-megapixel main camera sensor since the release of iPhone 6s in 2015.  However, Gurman says only the Pro models will get the 48-megapixel camera, while the regular iPhone models will have a 12-megapixel main sensor. Also, for the first time, only the Pro models will get Apple's new A16 chip, while the regular variants will either have the A15 (the same chip that powers the iPhone 13) or some variant of it.  Apple typically adds several big upgrades in terms of camera hardware on its Pro models; in the last couple of iterations, the difference was that the Pro models came with an additional telephoto camera on the back. But the standard and the Pro iPhone typically had the same (or very similar) main, wide camera; if Gurman's report is accurate, this will no longer be the case.  There will be other changes to Apple's phone lineup.", "Well ahead of Apple’s event last month, there had been rumors that this long era — 7 years is a practical century in technology time — was about to come to an end. Indeed, iPhone 14 Pro was announced with a 48 megapixel camera. Looking purely at the specs, it’s an impressive upgrade: the sensor is significantly larger in size, not just resolution. The lens is slightly slower (that is, its aperture isn’t quite as large as the previous years’) but once again, the overall light-gathering ability of the iPhone’s main shooter improves by as much as 33%.  The implications are clear: more pixels for more resolution; more light gathered for better low light shots, and finally, a bigger sensor for improvements in all areas including more shallow depth of field.  There’s a reason we chase the dragon of larger sensors in cameras; they allow for all our favorite photography subjects: details, low light and night shots, and nice bokeh. Your average digital camera sensor has a particularly interesting way to capture color. We’ve previously detailed this in our post about ProRAW, which you can read here, but we’ll quickly go over it again. Essentially, a camera sensor contains tiny pixels that can detect how much light comes in. For a dark area of an image, it will register darkness accurately, and vice versa for lighter areas.", "I took the iPhone 14 Pro on a trip around San Francisco and Northern California, to the remote Himalayas and mountains of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and Tokyo — to test every aspect of its image-making, and I have to say that I was pretty blown away by the results of the main camera. While arguably, a quad-bayer sensor should not give true 48-megapixel sensor resolution as one might get from, say, a comparable ‘proper’ digital camera, the results out of the iPhone 14 Pro gave me chills. I have simply never gotten image quality like this out of a phone. There’s more here than just resolution; the way the new 48 megapixel sensor renders the image is unique and simply tremendously different than what I’ve seen before. These photos were all shot in Apple’s ProRAW format and further developed in Lightroom or other image editors like Apple’s own Photos app. I was very impressed with the latitude of these files; I tend to expose my image for the highlights, shooting intentionally dark to boost shadows later, and these files have plenty of shadow information to do just that:  Detail-wise, we can see quite easily that it’s an incredible leap on previous iPhones, including the iPhone 13 Pro: It helps that Bhutan is essentially a camera test chart, with near-infinite levels of detail in their decorations to pixel-peep: Comparing to the iPhone 13 Pro, the comparison seems downright unfair.", "One of the biggest upgrades for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system is the main lens being increased to 48MP with what Apple calls an “advanced quad-pixel sensor.” However, the camera defaults to taking 12MP images. Read on for how to use the 48MP iPhone 14 Pro camera. Shooting with the full 48MP resolution main camera on the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t something you’ll want to do all the time with a single image ranging from 75 to 100MB+ in size. But when you want to capture the most amount of detail possible – allowing for impressive crops and edits – using the full power of the main iPhone 14 Pro camera is key. Offering 8064 x 6048 pixels, that’s 4x the resolution of 12MP shots. And Apple says “with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.” Note: 48MP image sizes range from 75-100MB+ each You can also choose to Preserve the ProRAW setting to on in the camera app instead of it resetting to available but off when you open the default camera – Settings > Camera > Preserve Settings > Apple ProRAW."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

But where OPT-175B is a general-purpose textbot, able to do anything from write fiction and answer questions to generate spam emails, BlenderBot 3 is a narrower project: it can have a conversation with you.

Just ask Microsoft’s “teen” chatbot Tay—except you can’t, because Tay was taken down when it started reproducing sexist and racist remarks shortly after it launched in 2016. Meta apparently believes that AI can learn to do better. The company just announced BlenderBot 3, a much more advanced chatbot designed to learn through conversation without getting into the kind of trouble that derailed Tay.

BlenderBot 3 learns facts by searching the web and retains information from all previous conversations as well as within a particular chat. It uses a new machine learning approach to identify trolls in order to ignore them. Meta’s technology also uses advances in AI that have produced much more linguistically capable computer programs in recent years. Training a particular type of artificial neural network on huge amounts of text data scraped from the web can produce algorithms capable of summarizing or generating text and that are able to hold conversations that can be more coherent and wide-ranging than the canned remarks of conventional chatbots.", "However, these models also have serious flaws: they regurgitate biases in their training data and often invent answers to users’ questions (a big problem if they’re going to be useful as digital assistants).

Even more importantly, users can then click on its responses to see where it got its information from. BlenderBot 3, in other words, can cite its sources.  By releasing the chatbot to the general public, Meta wants to collect feedback on the various problems facing large language models. Users who chat with BlenderBot will be able to flag any suspect responses from the system, and Meta says it’s worked hard to “minimize the bots’ use of vulgar language, slurs, and culturally insensitive comments.” Users will have to opt in to have their data collected, and if so, their conversations and feedback will be stored and later published by Meta to be used by the general AI research community.  “We are committed to publicly releasing all the data we collect in the demo in the hopes that we can improve conversational AI,” Kurt Shuster, a research engineer at Meta who helped create BlenderBot 3, told The Verge.

She was joined on the podium by silver medalist Shilese Jones and bronze medalist Jordan Chiles. Yes, the top three women’s gymnasts in the country are all Black. It was a very tight competition that saw first place and third place separated by only eight-tenths of a point. McClain was expected to be a part of the 2020 Olympic team, but a rough season combined with injuries led her to abruptly switch coaches—which is a decision not normally made during an Olympic cycle. Now, a year later, that change has clearly paid off. The bad news for the rest of the world is that the champion says she’s only at 75 percent, as she’s still recovering from a recent concussion and is dealing with stress fractures in both shins. McClain thinks she’ll be completely ready for the world championships later this year in England. “Anything can happen,’’ she said. “So I’m excited for the future.’’ After the first day of competition, McClain was a close second behind Jones, but a strong opening vault put her ahead of Jones, who fell off the balance beam.

Kayla DiCello took fourth, followed by Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey in fifth and Skye Blakely in sixth. McClain was expected to be a factor in the run-up to the Tokyo Games but struggled so much early in the competition season that she felt like “the most garbage gymnast ever,” as she said Wednesday. A change of scenery from West Virginia to Texas helped considerably. McClain has flourished at Dallas-based World Gymnastics Academy, owned and operated by Valeri Liukin, the father of 2008 Olympic champion Nastia Liukin. Her confidence has soared in lockstep with her development. She began Sunday just less than a point behind Jones but took the lead in the first rotation when she drilled her double Yurchenko vault while Jones hopped off the balance beam.

Tesla is raising the price of its \"Full Self Driving\" software to $15,000, Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. Tesla is facing scrutiny from federal and state officials over how it has advertised its self-driving technology, as well as concern over safety risks involved with the self-driving capability. Customers who order the Full Self Driving, or FSD, software before Sept. 5 will receive the product under the current price, Musk, Tesla's CEO, said in the tweet. The $3K price bump arrives as Tesla introduces FSD beta 10.69, a new iteration that boasts \"improved overall driving smoothness\" and \"reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks,\" according to the company. The FSD software doesn't make a car fully self-driving. Rather, users must remain focused on the road and keep their hands on the driving wheel. The Autopilot system, meanwhile, offers navigation to and from user-provided destinations, as well as suggestions for lane changes and other maneuvers to optimize a trip. Tesla has come under sharp criticism over its marketing of the FSD software and Autopilot. Earlier this month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alleged that the company deceptively advertises the products as fully autonomous, according to two filings with California's Office of Administrative Hearings. The filings were first reported by The Los Angeles Times.", "Tesla on Wednesday doubled down on the price war it started at the end of last year, as Musk said the company would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit. In the first quarter, Tesla posted its lowest quarterly gross profit margin in two years. \"The market wants to see that Tesla management has a tangible plan to boost automotive gross margins and companywide operating profit margins over the coming quarters and in the next year or so,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \"I also think the market wants to see a growth plan that does not involve continuous price cuts.\" Musk brushed aside those fears on Wednesday, saying the company this year would likely achieve full self driving and that would be a big profit generator. Musk has missed his previous targets to achieve self-driving capability, dating back years. Tesla now sells the FSD software, which does not make the vehicle autonomous, for $15,000. That is almost a third of the roughly $47,000 current starting price of the base Model Y in the United States. \"We're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy,\" he told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. \"I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.\" Skeptics remain over how soon Tesla will launch FSD.", "69, Tesla would increase the price of the package from $12,000 to $15,000. Today, Tesla updated its online configurator to reflect the change: For the extra $3,000, the FSD package doesn’t have more features, but the “coming soon” “Autosteer on city streets,” which is currently in invite-only beta, is a little better with the latest update. Of course, the quick answer is no. It’s absolutely wild that right now if you already have Enhanced Autopilot, the extra $9,000 for FSD gives you virtually nothing but the chance to maybe get access to FSD Beta, which itself is not a prize either. But that’s not really what you are buying. Since Musk has made it clear that he believes true self-driving is worth a lot more than $15,000, he says that the price will keep going up leading to self-driving. Therefore, buying FSD right now at $15,000 is more of a bet that Tesla will deliver true self-driving and that you are getting it at a discount over the final price right now. However, that’s a bet because the path from what FSD Beta is right now to a self-driving system safe enough that Tesla would take responsibility for it is not clear. It’s a bet that I made pre-FSD Beta day with a lot less information and fewer missed deadlines then.", "The cost of Tesla's Full Self Driving has increased 200% since it was revamped and made available to buy in 2019. Those lucky enough to buy FSD in April 2019 got it for the bargain basement price of $5,000 - it now costs $15,000 in the United States.   Elon Musk warned consumers through Twitter that FSD would be more expensive. On August 21 2022, he tweeted: After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5. Current price will be honored for orders made before September 5 but delivered later.   Tesla reorganized its Autopilot and FSD packages three years ago; basic Autopilot was introduced and became standard on every vehicle, while FSD was priced at $5,000. Enhanced Autopilot was removed as an option at the time, but was later reintroduced as a $6,000 option in June of 2022.   Before 2019 FSD was an add-on that required also buying Enhanced Autopilot. Enhanced Autopilot cost $5,000 and FSD was a $3,000 option on top of that if ordered with the vehicle. If you ordered FSD after taking delivery then it cost $4,000, which later went up to $5,000.", "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more.

In a post on Twitter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the new price will go into effect in North America starting September 5th, representing a $3,000 jump. Drivers who order a vehicle before September 5th won’t have to pay the newly-increased price, Musk says. The price hike comes as Tesla begins rolling out FSD beta 10.69 to drivers, a version Musk calls “a big step forward.” It’s still unclear whether Tesla plans on raising the price of its FSD subscription, which currently costs $199 per month. The FSD software lets drivers use Tesla’s advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), Autopilot, to navigate to and from specific destinations, among other driver-assist features.

It’s been three years since Game Of Thrones ended, and five years since its fandom started complaining bitterly about its final seasons.

Immediately, its premiere boasts everything that Thrones did well: an overqualified cast of character actors; backstabbing; sexposition; and lots of dragons. The first proposed spin-off to Game Of Thrones – a Naomi Watts-led adventure set in Westeros’ distant past – was ultimately scrapped, reportedly because it was too different from the original show. Perhaps as a result, it sometimes feels like there’s an element of overcorrection here. It’s beautifully rendered - the budget is clearly late-season Game Of Thrones rather than Season 1, and both the Cornish and Spanish locations and the computer-generated dragon flights look magical - but looks and sounds awfully close to its progenitor, down to iconography and locations. That’s not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to the storytelling, since it’s set just far enough in Westeros’ past to keep us guessing, but it speaks of a pervasive timidity in Hollywood to take even the most minor of risks.

The last time USC had a Heisman winner was 2005, when running back Reggie Bush was the second of consecutive Trojans players to win the award. Matt Leinart won the Heisman in 2004 on the way to a national championship. Bush’s Heisman win, the Trojans’ seventh, was later vacated for NCAA violations that began the descent of USC. Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma each have seven Heisman victories. TOP MOMENTS FROM THE NIGHT How the voting played out Here is a look at the final order of the 2022 Heisman Trophy voting.

Williams edged finalists Max Duggan of TCU, C.J. Stroud of Ohio State and Stetson Bennett IV of Georgia -- all quarterbacks -- to become the Trojans' first Heisman winner since running back Reggie Bush, who was later forced to vacate his 2005 award. Williams passed for 4,075 yards, 37 touchdowns and just four interceptions while completing 66.1% of his passes this season. He guided USC to an 11-2 record and appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game where he played through injuries in a loss to Utah. His victory gives USC eight Heismans, most among any program in the nation. However, given the Heisman Trust and NCAA no longer recognize Bush as having won the trophy in 2005, USC will be listed with seven Heismans, tying it for most all-time with Notre Dame, Ohio State and Oklahoma.", "North Carolina Tarheels quarterback Drake Maye landed on the Heisman Watch out of nowhere this past season. The freshman finished with 4,321 passing yards, 45 total touchdowns and nearly hit 700 rushing yards in his first full season. He loses wide receivers Josh Downs and Antoine Green, but he proved that he is a bonafide star at quarterback. While there might be some growing pains with the staff changes, Maye should thrive in Chip Lindsey’s offense once he settles in. A Heisman Trophy finalist before his season-ending knee injury, Michigan Wolverines running back Blake Corum made the stunning decision to return for the 2023 season. While there is a strong likelihood that Jim Harbaugh will be gone, Corum is well-positioned to repeat his success from a season ago.  The 5-foot-8 running back should be the focal point of Michigan’s offense once again, putting him in a position for 1,500 scrimmage yards and 20 total touchdowns.

Les Violets are the current holders of the Coupe de France, and have won the second tier Ligue 2 on three occasions.[2] Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.[3] They are currently participating in the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League, following their victory in the preceding year's Coupe de France.

The deal will see RedBird acquire an 85 per cent majority stake in the club, who were recently relegated to the second-tier Ligue 2. Previous owner Olivier Sadran will step down as Toulouse president with immediate effect, but will retain a 15 per cent stake in the club and remain a member of the board of directors. Sadran will be replaced in the role of president by Damien Comolli, who has held senior management roles at various top European soccer clubs including Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Fenerbahçe and Saint-Étienne. “We are proud and excited to help write the next chapter of Toulouse FC and realise its tremendous potential,” said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners. “We are committed to building a sustainable, long-term foundation for the club’s success by enhancing its on-field sporting performance, business operations and contributions to its community.  “We look forward to working closely with Olivier, the city of Toulouse and the Occitanie region to return Toulouse FC to an elite level and elevate the entire city of Toulouse through its long-term success.” Report: City Football Group turns attention to Troyes Sadran added: “I welcome Gerry and RedBird as new partners in an organisation and a city that are big parts of my life.", "It is easy to imagine that Damien Comolli sees football like a game of chess. The Toulouse chairman is always thinking, plotting and pre-empting: Ask him a question, and his answer will often have a nod to what you're going to ask next. For example, one Tuesday afternoon in October, on a Zoom call from behind the glass desk in his office at Toulouse -- a rugby-loving city in southern France -- he is describing how various sporting executives called upon his help in the eight years he was away from the game. \"I will not name names, before you ask,\" Comolli says. He must always be a step ahead, and that mindset has made him one of the most forward-thinking executives in European football. For the past two decades, Comolli has been something of a revolutionary, but without the trophy-laden success or applause one might expect. A decade ago, he served as a sporting director at Tottenham and then Liverpool, and there is an argument to say that his warm embrace for data analytics laid the groundwork for what allowed the two clubs to be successful under Mauricio Pochettino and Jurgen Klopp, respectively. However, Comolli was not rewarded: He was sacked at each club before his plans began to bear fruit. In his current role at Toulouse, though, he does not have that problem. He is, essentially, his own boss.", "Toulouse Football Club is a French professional football club based in Toulouse.

The deal means a Tencent subsidiary owns 16.25% of FromSoftware’s shares, while Sony Interactive Entertainment owns 14.09%. The rest is owned by FromSoftware parent Kadokawa Corporation. Shanghai-based Tencent is the world’s largest video game vendor, owing largely to its dominance within China’s vast market. It’s also well known for taking significant positions in — if not buying outright — big-name publishers and developers outside of China.

After all, 2022 has seen an unprecedented number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the games industry: The year began with Take-Two acquiring mobile giant Zynga and the bombshell purchase of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Other high-profile acquisitions include Bungie and Haven Studios by Sony, and Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal and Square Enix Montréal by Embracer Group. The latter also recently acquired five more companies resulting in the acquisition of the rights to Lord of the Rings IP. Meanwhile, rumors continue to swirl that Ubisoft and EA are both seeking buyers. Finally, just yesterday, NetEase announced that it will be acquiring Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human developer Quantic Dream.

He took over as the head coach in December after being hired by Penn State to serve as the defensive coordinator but then left that position and signed a six-year contract with Virginia Tech.", "docs": ["BLACKSBURG, Va. — It wasn’t that long ago that Virginia Tech football’s Beamerball — an idiosyncratic mix of Tidewater talent, special teams wizardry and Metallica entrances — made the Hokies a national brand, and Brent Pry was there. “This was Clemson before Clemson was Clemson,” Pry said. Pry, a graduate assistant under legendary Hokies coach Frank Beamer and defensive coordinator Bud Foster from 1995 to 1997, left his defensive coordinator job at Penn State to sign a six-year contract as Virginia Tech’s head coach in December. Now he’s tasked with a balancing act of modernizing the program while maintaining the Beamer culture. And winning big. “I was not trying to re-create ‘Coach Beamer and Coach Bud 2.0,’ ” Athletic Director Whit Babcock said about hiring Pry. Virginia Tech is mindful of how it is messaging its second attempt at life after Beamer because the first one failed. When the program’s architect and native son announced his retirement in 2015, Babcock moved swiftly to hire Justin Fuente, then the coach of a surging Memphis program and one of the hottest names in the industry.", "In Brent Pry’s first season as Virginia Tech’s football coach, the Hokies had five games decided by less than a touchdown. They lost the first four of those before nipping Liberty 23-22 in what turned out to be the season finale. That victory is an example of why Pry believes Year 1 has positioned his program to make major strides in 2023. “I haven’t been around a team that was 3-8 and has so much momentum and so much excitement in the offseason,” said Pry this week. “There’s a pretty good feeling buzzing around here right now.” Pry said that’s shown up in his team’s attitude and approach to this offseason, Tech’s dealings in the NCAA transfer portal, and the response from recruits, particularly around the commonwealth of Virginia. All despite winning just three games, against Boston College, Wofford and Liberty, and going 1-6 in the ACC before its game against rival Virginia was canceled following the deaths of three players in an on-campus shooting. For Pry, who spent the past 11 seasons as a defensive coordinator at Penn State, Vanderbilt and Georgia Southern, the biggest adjustment to becoming a head coach was simply the scale of his responsibilities. “All those years as a coordinator, you had a staff of about 10. You had 45 players on my side of the ball,” said Pry, who took over a Tech program that went 24-23 the previous four seasons.", "“He’s going to make Grant better. Grant’s going to make him better,” said Pry. “And we’ve got a healthy quarterback competition.” Getting improved quarterback play, more production from the wide receiving corps and a better pass rush are three of the areas Pry said Tech is focused on this offseason. Those will be keys if the Hokies are to win more games in Pry’s second season. “So many people recognized the progress that we did make,” said Pry. “I don’t know that there’s more excitement around a 3-8 team in the country than there is around ours. Being out there on the recruiting trail in December and January, we felt it.” Note: Virginia Tech added a recruit Wednesday, which was the start of NCAA Division I football’s second signing period. Junior-college defensive end James Jennette from College of the Canyons in California tweeted Wednesday that he has signed with Tech. Jennette, who is from North Carolina, began his college career at William and Mary. He is rated the No. 8 junior college recruit in the nation by 247sports.com.

J.C. Price, the Hokies' interim coach who will lead Virginia Tech in their bowl game after Justin Fuente's exit on Nov. 16, was also in attendance.

While Jackie herself isn’t necessarily as popular nowadays compared to when she did wow us on our television screens all those years ago, what Jackie has nevertheless created over the last decade or so, is a musical genre and style that is as underappreciated as it is undervalued, to say the least.

Not to be confused with the hit song from ‘The Lion King,’ MATANA is the latest term to describe the market’s technology leaders. The catchy sextet (in order) consists of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)  and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It represents a powerful group of companies driving the world’s biggest innovations — from electronic devices and software to artificial intelligence and e-commerce.  The MATANA stocks comprise nearly 50% of the widely followed Nasdaq-100 index. Since they influence the benchmark’s day-to-day returns so much, growth investors should be well-versed in how these companies perform.  The MATANA group has largely replaced FAANG as the tech sector bellwether. Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) once ruled the roost in high tech. But with Meta Platforms facing a digital ad spending slowdown and Netflix experiencing subscriber losses, social media and streaming video have lost some of their luster.", "MATANA refers to the six major U.S. technology companies – Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN).", "It's time to rethink who's at the top of the Big Tech food-chain, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder Ray Wang told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Wang argued that MATANA — Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) – is an upgrade to FAANG by dropping Meta (META) and Netflix (NFLX) while adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. In 2013, when Jim Cramer of CNBC's \"Mad Money\" coined the term FAANG, many of those companies were thought of as upstarts who'd taken their respective markets by storm. This was especially true of Meta — then Facebook — and Netflix. But now, Wang said, both should be re-assessed. Meta, in particular, needs a new plan. \"Facebook has got to do something besides ads,\" he told Yahoo Finance. \"Once again, they're taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the glasses? Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that's really kind of what the challenge is.\" For Netflix, it's a question of growth, and what is and isn't on the table. And because the company's operating on a subscription model, Wang has questions about how much further they could go. \"The reason they're out is because, how many more subscribers?", "Compared to other prominent groups like FANG, FAANG, or MAMAA, MATANA has a lot to offer to investors. However, it remains to be seen whether the AI boom will become the future of the technology industry or if it will only be a passing trend because many of these companies are increasing their profits thanks to AI. The MATANA group is composed of the six largest and most influential technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). These companies are recognized for their significant market presence, innovation, and dominance in their respective sectors. According to Nasdaq, Alphabet stock is considered the best in the MATANA group for long-term investment. This recommendation is based on Alphabet’s market dominance in search, particularly with Google holding a 76% dominance compared to other search engines. Analysts believe that this market position will continue to drive Alphabet’s long-term growth through its advertising offerings. Additionally, Alphabet has diversified its business beyond searches, expanding into areas such as digital advertising, cloud services, and artificial intelligence (IA). FAANG is an acronym that stands for Facebook (now called Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (now called Alphabet). These are some of the most prominent and well-known technology stocks in the market.", "Notably, FAANG is an extension of the FANG group, it includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), the producer of MacBooks and iPhones, as the fifth renowned company. The MAANG group is an extension of FAANG, the term was coined after Facebook was transformed into Meta Platforms. As a result, the “F” letter was replaced with “M”. Further in this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. The MATANA group is composed of six high-level technology companies: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple Inc, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Amazon.com Inc.

In terms of market dominance, the stocks of the MATANA group make up almost 50% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Therefore, these companies have a significant influence on the tech market’s returns. This has led the MATANA group to replace the FAANG group as a reference in the tech industry.

Susie dreams of solving her very own big case someday, volunteering at the local sheriff’s department and channeling all of her enthusiasm for clues and suspects into the true-crime podcast she diligently records and promotes … even though nobody’s listening. It seems as though her dream finally comes true when her classmate Jesse (Alex Wolff) disappears, and Susie is the one who tracks him down and rescues him. Susie basks in the glow of Jesse’s heartfelt gratitude and the public attention she receives for her detective work. Everything finally seems to be going her way — or is it?", "The dark humor, social commentary and tonal shifts reminded me of Gus Van Sant’s prescient To Die For as Susie Searches offers an uncomfortable but fascinating melding of crime and self-worth in the media age. Liz Whittemore Kiersey Clemons, who gave such a memorable early performance in the underrated father/daughter indie Hearts Beat Loud, holds this intriguing film together. She is the Susie of the title, a young, amateur sleuth with a podcast in search of listeners. Director Sophie Kargman, who co-wrote the film with William Day Frank, has something interesting to say about the search for internet validation and the allure of true crime. When Susie solves the abduction of popular classmate Jesse (Alex Wolff, delivering another standout performance), she basks in the newfound attention until the walls start closing in. The dark humor, social commentary and tonal shifts reminded me of Gus Van Sant’s prescient To Die For as Susie Searches offers an uncomfortable but fascinating melding of crime and self-worth in the media age.  Cate Marquis Sincere, smiling and hard-working college student Susie Wallis (Kiersey Clemons) has always had an unerring knack for figuring out mysteries, going back to her childhood when her mother would read her mysteries stories. Her social media site, “Susie Searches,” features her super-sleuthing skills as she solves true-crime mysteries.", "Susie hopes to become an internet sensation, and make enough money to give her and her mother, now bed-ridden with MS, a more comfortable life. But “Susie Searches” isn’t taking off as hoped, unlike the meditation site hosted by campus hunk Jesse (Alex Wolff). When Jesse suddenly goes missing, Susie seizes the opportunity to solve the mystery and make “Susie Searches” a hit. Cute and colorful, SUSIE SEARCHES is a “girl detective” mystery story in the Nancy Drew mode – until it isn’t. Actor-turned-director Sophie Kargman turns this sunny tale in a wholly unexpected direction. As Susie, Kiersey Clemons is impressive, as the title character finds her way through the plot’s twists. In her feature film directorial debut, Kargman takes the script she co-wrote with William Day Frank and the idea of their short film, and transforms it into a tale you don’t see coming, until it is right upon you."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

The multi-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will join Richard Childress Racing in 2023, according to a report from Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. The move ends a successful 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing. An official announcement is expected Tuesday, per the report. The news punctuates an eventful and “stressful” regular season for Busch, whose free agency dominated headlines and clouded a playoff-caliber season in 2022. It did so because his looming free agency revealed a strange reality in NASCAR economics — that one of the sport’s biggest stars would have to struggle to find a home (even with taking a pay cut) because of something outside of his control. That “something” outside of his control, in this case, was the result of the Mars Inc. decision to exit NASCAR at the end of the year, leaving Joe Gibbs Racing (Busch’s current team) without a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team. Busch confirmed to reporters earlier this month that he had “more than one” team extend official contract offers to him. RCR was among those companies, per reports at the time. He also said that his uncertain future had been weighing on him. “It weighs on you every time, every day of the week,” Busch said at NASCAR’s playoff media day before the race at Darlington.", "Kyle Busch will move to Richard Childress Racing next season, ending a 15-year career with Joe Gibbs Racing because the team could not come to terms with NASCAR's only active multiple Cup champion. Busch will drive the No. 8 Chevrolet for Childress in an announcement made Tuesday at the NASCAR Hall of Fame. He wore the two Cup championship rings he won driving for Gibbs on his middle fingers. \"I'll be taking my talents to Welcome, North Carolina, to drive the No. 8 car starting in 2023,\" Busch said of moving to the team based about an hour north of Charlotte. Tyler Reddick, who is currently competing for the Cup championship in the No. 8 Chevrolet, will remain under contract at RCR and drive for the team next season. Reddick in July told Childress he was moving to 23XI Racing in 2024. Richard Childress said he informed Reddick he'd be out of the No. 8 next season one hour before Busch's announcement. Childress said he'd obtain a third charter for Reddick's car, but gave no other details except that Reddick's current crew chief will be paired with Busch next season. When Childress joined Busch at the announcement, the Hall of Fame team owner presented Busch's 7-year-old son, Brexton, with a contract option to someday drive for RCR.", "Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Kyle Busch will leave Joe Gibbs Racing at the end of the 2022 season and join Richard Childress Racing beginning in 2023, according to a report by Jordan Bianchi of The Athletic. An official announcement of Busch's move to RCR is expected to come Tuesday. The two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will leave Joe Gibbs Racing after a 15-year tenure that saw Busch become one of the greatest drivers of his generation as well as one of the greatest in NASCAR history, earning 56 of his 60 career victories behind the wheel of a Gibbs Toyota. Busch's departure comes after a protracted contract situation that could not be resolved, as Joe Gibbs Racing was unable to find a sponsor capable of replacing the departing Mars Inc. and meeting Busch's salary demands. Busch is expected to be replaced behind the wheel of the No. 18 Toyota by Ty Gibbs, the 19-year old grandson of Joe Gibbs and a star in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. It is uncertain whether Busch will drive a third car for Richard Childress Racing or replace Tyler Reddick behind the wheel of the No. 8 Chevrolet.", "Kyle Busch, driver of the No. 18 M&M's Thank You Fans!

The two-time Nascar Cup Series champion is officially a driver for Richard Childress Racing, as he will take over the No. 8 Chevrolet in 2023. The move is a serious blow to Toyota, which invested in Busch when he joined the OEM in 2008 as a hot-headed young gun. No matter what trouble Busch got himself into, Toyota and Mars Wrigley — his primary sponsor until 2022 — always had his back. Two championships and dozens of wins later, Busch was waiting for JGR to sign a new primary sponsor and then have a contract extension of his own. But when an unreported company backed out late in the going, it left JGR with little time to find a new multi-million dollar primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 car. In return, team owner Joe Gibbs’ grandson Ty Gibbs will take over the car, which moves the No. 54, in 2023. Now, Busch will focus on his return to Chevrolet, the manufacturer that believed in him from the start.", "36  Editor’s Note: This story is included in The Athletic’s Best of 2022.

An official announcement is expected Tuesday. Advertisement Busch is making the move following prolonged negotiations with JGR and several teams that led to much discourse on which team he’d sign with. The 37-year-old Busch is in the final season of a multiyear contract with JGR and the two sides had been negotiating a contract extension for some time. However, those discussions were hampered because JGR had not secured a primary sponsor for Busch’s No. 18 team beyond this season. The team’s current primary sponsor, Mars Inc., is leaving JGR at the conclusion of the 2022 season after sponsoring Busch since he began his tenure with JGR in 2008. JGR has known of Mars’ eventual departure since last summer and has been working to find a replacement.

Titus Welliver is set to play the iconic DC villain and Superman’s archnemesis, Lex Luthor, in the upcoming season 4 of Titans. The show has been setting up Luthor’s arrival since season two when Conner/Superboy (played by Joshua Orpin) debuted in Titans. Superboy is a clone of both Clark Kent and Lex Luthor in Titans, and season 4 will explore the character’s dark side. Titus Welliver is likely to play a major role in Titans season 4 as Lex Luthor, and taking on a fan-favorite antagonist comes with a big responsibility.

The HBO Max show's fourth season is set to premiere in November, with the creators looking at some interesting developments with the shrewd criminal mastermind, who has become a pop-culture figure over the years. What makes this even more interesting is the strong link between Connor, aka Superboy (Joshua Orpin), and Lex, who happens to be one of the DNAs used to create Superboy (the other being Superman, of course). Titus Welliver is no stranger to the spotlight, having appeared in a series of great shows like Deadwood and Sons of Anarchy. According to showrunner Greg Walker, Titans' approach to Lex's character \"has a very sensitive, thoughtful approach to evil and power,\" which would explain why Wellevier is such a natural choice. Read on for more details about Titus Welliver and his role as Lex Luthor in Titans.  Instagram Post Born on March 12, 1962, in New Haven, Connecticut, Welliver grew up in an artistic environment, with his father Neil being a renowned landscape painter and his mother Norma a fashion illustrator. He was raised in Philadelphia and New York City. He credits a lot of his creative development to the environment he grew up in. Titus Welliver wanted to become a painter like his father but later decided to pursue acting.", "As shown in the fourth season's first episode, Titans will also seemingly have a storyline in which Lex Luthor is dying from a terminal illness, further echoing the character's post-Crisis history. This fidelity to the modern version of Lex -- not to mention Titus Welliver's own acting skills -- can easily make him the best version of Lex Luthor yet in live-action. The versions played Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, Jesse Eisenberg and arguably even Jon Cryer were very much in the mad scientist realm, with only Michael Rosenbaum's truly embodying the cold, petty businessman of the newer comics. By combining his previous character's contempt for authority with a decidedly narcissistic streak, Titus Welliver could bring to the small screen what John Byrne wrote decades ago in the comic books.

Again, Google Cloud is already strong when we think about how we analyze data and put it in context, and that only gets stronger with Mandiant.” Venables was very clear that Google Cloud's ambitions in cybersecurity are massive, but on some level, the size of the deal already said it all. The acquisition is Google's second-largest ever, surpassed only by the company's $12.5 billion buyout of Motorola ten years ago.

Link returns next year in the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild. Nintendo capped off its September Direct presentation with a new trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild, now officially titled The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The game is set to launch for Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023. Although brief, the trailer offers a look at some new gameplay footage, showcasing more landscapes and several new powers that Link will be able to wield in the upcoming game. You can watch the full video below. The Breath of the Wild sequel was first revealed during E3 2019, and was initially planned to launch in 2022. Earlier this year, however, Nintendo announced it was delaying the game to spring 2023 to give the team some additional development time. \"We previously announced that we were aiming for a 2022 release for this game. However, we have decided to extend our development time a bit and change the release to spring 2023,\" Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said in a video message. \"For those of you who have been looking forward to a release this year, we apologize.", "While Nintendo has rarely released direct sequels to Zelda games in the past, Aonuma previously explained that the impetus behind Tears of the Kingdom is the wealth of ideas the development team came up with when making DLC for the first game. \"When we released the DLC for Breath of the Wild, we realized that this is a great way to add more elements to the same world,\" Aonuma said. \"But when it comes down to technical things, DLC is pretty much data -- you're adding data to a preexisting title. And so when we wanted to add bigger changes, DLC is not enough, and that's why we thought maybe a sequel would be a good fit.\"  The original Breath of the Wild launched alongside the Nintendo Switch in March 2017, and it would go on to become one of the most critically and commercially successful games in the franchise, selling more than 26 million copies.", "Critics praised its open-ended gameplay, open-world design, and attention to detail, though some criticized its technical performance. It is the best-selling Zelda game and one of the best-selling video games of all time, with 32.35 million copies sold by 2023.  Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020 while a sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023.  Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,[1] scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.[2] Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.[3] The game also integrates a \"chemistry engine\" that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.", "Nintendo has announced that the name of its forthcoming Breath of the Wild sequel is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Now it is up to three high-school students to figure out how to stop the ravenous witches from wreaking a new kind of havoc on Salem before midnight on All Hallow’s Eve.” The film also stars Whitney Peak, Lilia Buckingham, and Belissa Escobedo as the three teenagers who must stop the witches when they return to the land of the living for another night of Halloween frolic.", "It opens with the Sanderson Sisters being given the magic book on their 16th birthday, which appears to be the opening of the movie.

She pledged to act “in the exclusive interests of the nation” – a promise then repeated by her 24 ministers, six of them women.

Meloni has come to power partly by fortune. Her Brothers of Italy party was one of very few that chose not to join Mario Draghi's national unity government and she became a solitary opposition voice. Although she has led her party for 10 years, her experience in government is limited to a spell as Italy's youngest minister in the Berlusconi government from 2008-11. Her party won the September 2022 elections with 26% of the vote, even though it had polled only 4.3% four years earlier. \"Italians have sent a clear message in favour of a right-wing government led by Brothers of Italy,\" she declared after her election win.

Below, we’ve captured some of that email:  For those of us on the old legacy $14.99 price, this is quite the jump. An extra $8 per month is likely still worth it for most of us, since YouTube ads are the worst and the subscription includes YouTube Music, but I can also see why many might look to cut off subscriptions.

YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) costs $11.99 per month, after a one-month free trial. If you're sure about the service and want to commit for a year, there's an annual plan available for $119.99. That's two months of savings for paying upfront.

It allows you to add up to five other people (six total members) who are at least 13 years old and live in your household so they get the same benefits. Per YouTube's terms, these people must live at the same address as you. If you're a student who can provide verification (required each year), the price of the Student YouTube Premium plan is $6.99 per month instead.

The family tier offers benefits like ad-free viewing and background playback for you and up to five other people, and it now costs $5 more per month.

While the main announcement says that the price increase starts on the next billing cycle on or after November 21st, some legacy subscribers won't see their bill jump for several months. One Engadget staffer was informed that their price would not increase until April due to their status as a \"long-standing and valued member.\" With the new price structure, the family plan is less of a bargain for smaller groups.

LONDON — Rishi Sunak becomes Britain's third prime in under two months at a time when the U.K. faces what he has termed a \"profound economic challenge\" and as his Conservative Party struggles to heal divisive wounds from months of infighting. He now leads the Conservatives with a substantial parliamentary majority inherited since the 2019 general election, when his former boss Boris Johnson helped win seats in areas of Britain that had never traditionally voted for the center right party. \"It is only right to explain why I am standing here as your new prime minister,\" Sunak told the crowd of journalists gathered outside No. 10 Downing Street's famous front door, after formally accepting his new role from King Charles during a meeting at Buckingham Palace. \"Right now our country is facing a profound economic crisis,\" he said. \"The aftermath of COVID still lingers.", "The former chancellor wins Conservative Party leadership contest days after the dramatic resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister. Rishi Sunak will become the United Kingdom’s new prime minister after winning the ruling Conservative Party’s leadership contest, which was triggered by the resignation of Liz Truss last week. Sunak’s win on Monday came days after Truss’s resignation after her disastrous tax cuts plans and policy U-turns plunged the markets into chaos. The unprecedented economic crisis drew a rare intervention from the Bank of England. Britain faces serious economic challenges and needs stability and unity, Sunak said on Monday in his first public speech since winning the contest. “There is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” Sunak said. “We now need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.” Sunak, a former finance minister, has been left with the task of steering a deeply divided country through an economic downturn set to make millions of people poorer.

(Oct. 25) LONDON (AP) — Rishi Sunak became Britain’s third prime minister this year on Tuesday, tasked with taming an economic crisis that has left the country’s finances in a precarious state and millions struggling to pay their food and energy bills. Sunak, who is the U.K.’s first leader of color, met King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, where the monarch officially asked the new leader of the governing Conservative Party to form a government, as is tradition. Sunak clinched the leadership position Monday, seen by his party as a safe pair of hands to stabilize an economy sliding toward recession — and stem its own plunging popularity, after the brief, disastrous term of Liz Truss.  Her package of unfunded tax cuts spooked financial markets with the prospect of ballooning debt, drove the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to intervene — weakening Britain’s fragile economy and obliterating Truss’ authority within her party. In one of his first acts, Sunak announced he would retain Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt, appointed by Truss to steady the markets two weeks ago amid the turmoil.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence. What was once unthinkable finally happened: Netflix rolled out a cheaper streaming plan that includes ads. Netflix initially said that its ad-supported plan wouldn’t arrive until 2023, but the “Basic with Ads” tier–eventually renamed “Standard with Ads”–went live in the fall of 2022, much sooner than expected. So, how much does Netflix with ads cost, and what’s included? Here’s what you need to know. Updated on July 19, 2023 with details on how “Basic with Ads” is now called “Standard with Ads” following the elimination of the ad-free “Basic” plan. Netflix Standard with Ads costs $6.99 a month, or $8.50 a month less than Netflix’s least expensive ad-free plan. For some context, Paramount+ and Peacock Premium (which, confusingly, is ad-supported, versus the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus) each cost $4.99 a month, while ad-supported Hulu costs $6/month. Meanwhile, HBO Max with ads goes for $10 a month, while Disney+ will charge $8 a month for its upcoming “with ads” plan. As it stands, Netflix’s cheapest ad-free plan, Standard, currently costs $15.49 a month for a single stream. Nope, or at least not yet.", "After receiving consumer pushback from raising its subscription prices, Netflix rolled out its newest tier: Basic with Ads, in November 2022. The ads tier subscription is $6.99 per month – almost 55% lower per month than its Standard subscription. While the monthly cost is lower for consumers, the newest tier comes with hidden price tags. In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers. The second nuance with Netflix Basic with Ads tier comes from what shows and movies are offered at this level. Similar to the unpredictable ad experience, the available titles on the Basic tier seems extremely scattered without a rhyme or reason.", "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.

The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription … as long as they’re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback. The plan is called Basic With Ads, and the $6.99 figure is much more aligned with consumer expectations compared with the bloated premium $20 subscription — which I discovered I was still somehow paying for over the course of reporting this story. Swapping for the budget option was a no-brainer.", "Netflix’s new ad tier is set to launch in the U.S. at 9 a.m. PT on Thursday, introducing commercials to the service for the first time in its 15-year history. Starting Thursday, the ad plan will be available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. It will then launch in Spain on Nov. 10. At $6.99 per month, Netflix Basic with Ads costs less than half of Netflix’s $15.49 Standard plan and almost a third less than its ad-free $9.99 Basic plan.  In exchange for that lower price tag, subscribers who switch to the ad-supported plan will have to watch an average of five minutes of ads per hour that are set to play before and during movies and TV shows. At launch, ads will be 15 to 30 seconds in length. During an October press call, Netflix chief operating officer and product chief Greg Peters said that new movies coming to Netflix “will just have a pre-roll” of ads followed by an uninterrupted viewing experience in order to “preserve that cinematic model.” He added that movies that have “been on the service for a while” will have a more “traditional” mix of pre-roll and mid-roll ads. There are a few other additional drawbacks to the ad tier.", "Related Stories Move over \"Stranger Things,\" the next big Netflix hit may just be commercials. The streaming giant on Thursday is rolling out its cheapest membership tier, dubbed \"Basic With Ads.\" The new tier will cost $6.99 per month, which makes it a full $3 cheaper than Netflix's current cheapest plan, the $9.99 Basic plan. It's Netflix's first foray into the ad-supported space — the streamer has for years resisted putting any advertising on its platform. The company's plan arrives on Nov. 3, a month before rival streaming service Disney+ will introduce its own ad-supported tier, and competes with ad-supported plans from services like Hulu and Peacock. The plan's launch comes as Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing on its platform. Beginning next year, Netflix will push people who borrow accounts to create their own, and will also give account-holders who share their passwords the ability to pay extra to have friends and family on their accounts. Here's what you need to know about Netflix's Basic With Ads tier. The Basic With Ads plan will operate similarly to the Basic plan.

As of Wednesday, Nov. 16 Republicans officially gained the control of the 2023 U.S. House as incumbent Republican Mike Garcia was declared victorious in California’s House District 27—the 218th seat filled by the GOP in this fall’s election.  As Dec. 13, incumbent Republican Lauren Boebert was declared victorious over Democrat Adam Frisch in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, giving Republicans 222 wins in this fall’s election, compare to 213 for Democrats.

A special election to fill that seat is scheduled for Feb. 21, 2023. Prior to the 2022 election, the House was controlled by Democrats, who held an eight-seat margin among the 433 currently filled voting seats (two seats were vacant). All 435 voting seats as well as five of the six non-voting seats were up for election. Republicans needed to pick up five seats to gain majority, and this was entirely possible for a variety of reasons, including that the party in control of the White House typically loses seats in Congress during midterm elections.

It wasn't the red wave many top Republicans predicted, but the GOP eked out enough wins in contested seats to gain control of the House of Representatives, according to The Associated Press. With some races still not called a week after Election Day, Republicans picked up at least 218 seats, and will take over the chamber next year with GOP leaders facing blowback about failing to deliver in what many considered a favorable political environment for their party.   The potentially single-digit margin ushers in a new era of divided government in Washington. Going into the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats knew historic trends would favor that the party out of power gains seats.

The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rated 36 races as toss-ups. A shift in five seats was the determining factor as to whether the chamber would go to Republicans. Midterm elections historically hurt the president’s party. In 18 of the last 20 elections the president’s party lost ground in the House. Redistricting played a significant role in the 2022 House elections. New lines altered the competitiveness in numerous districts, and some incumbents ran for re-election in the new territory. After the 2020 Census, state legislatures or commissions drew congressional district lines. Both parties filed lawsuits to challenge these new maps. Republicans controlled line-drawing in far more districts than Democrats and, as a result, gained more seats in the House from redistricting alone. Midterms are generally viewed as a referendum on the president. With low approval ratings and high inflation, the Biden administration’s politics, policies, and polling shaped the national atmosphere. The results of the 2022 midterms held true to form, with the opposing party gaining House majority. In the final months before Election Day, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) raised about $113.2 million, in contrast to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s (DCCC) $110.7 million.", "A Republican House will likely clash on most issues with a Democratic Senate in 2023, with bitter fights over basic functions like funding the government threatening to paralyze Washington.    GOP candidates hoped to capitalize on voter frustration with the rising costs of groceries and gas, framing the election as a referendum on President Joe Biden and his party's rule of both the White House and Congress. But voters in exit polls indicated other issues like abortion rights and protecting democracy factored into their decisions at the ballot box. Redistricting in New York and Florida also helped the GOP overcome lackluster results in most of the races rated as toss-ups. The last time the president and top congressional leaders were from different parties was 2019, when Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms, two years after former President Donald Trump was elected president.  A new House Republican majority will mean Biden's legislative agenda is essentially dead, unless he can find bipartisan support for some narrowly crafted proposals. Biden's focus during the next two years of his presidency will likely be spent defending his signature accomplishments, like a bill lowering prescription drug prices and investing hundreds of billions of dollars to tackle climate change. GOP lawmakers have already said they want to roll back some of Biden's programs, or defund many of them.

Cortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

And, on November 18, 2022, the BBC revealed that Millie Gibson will join Gatwa as the new companion. Interestingly, all the press around this news has focused on the word companion, as in a singular companion, rather than a group of companions.

Mexico Poland Argentina Argentina Poland Mexico Saudi Arabia Argentina Saudi Arabia Poland Mexico Argentina Poland Mexico Saudi Arabia After Lionel Messi at last led Argentina to an international title last summer, when the Albiceleste topped rival Brazil for the Copa America crown, can the 35-year-old footballing icon cap his legacy with an elusive World Cup title?

It has been a while since the profilers' last on-screen case, but the characters' stories continued during that period. Granted that revival retcons the Criminal Minds finale in several ways, it's essentially the same thing. That being said, Paramount+ just cannot simply use the title Criminal Minds season 16 because the project is different in a couple of significant ways from its original run. That includes veering away from its episodic storytelling format to a more serialized one, not to mention being darker and more disturbing than CBS' iteration. By giving the Criminal Minds revival a new title, Paramount+ allows it to be both a reboot and a continuation of the CBS series. Calling it Criminal Minds season 16 could also be confusing if the project doesn’t address every single plot line that the finale left loose, which puts a lot of burden on the new series. Having its official title of Criminal Minds: Evolution quickly establishes that the show is part of the Criminal Minds brand, which could entice some formers fans to check it out, especially those who haven’t been keeping track of Paramount+’s efforts to bring back the BAU on the small screen. Overall, despite the series of changes coming the BAU's way, it's all for the better.", "Showrunner Erica Messer and her team are fully taking advantage of the creative wiggler room offered by being on a streaming platform than on network TV by coming up with a more disturbing UnSub that poses a big challenge to the profilers, which makes for a more interesting narrative.

Many aspects of the original Criminal Minds run will stay the same, but Evolutions has some fresh aspects, including a new title. Retitling Paramount+'s Criminal Minds revival as Criminal Minds: Evolution is appropriate given this new version of the show. The project is a continuation of its CBS run, so technically, it isn't really a \"reboot\" as it has usually been referred to. The cast remains the same and its events take place in the same continuity. Instead of calling it Criminal Minds season 16, however, giving it a different title allows it to separate itself from the CBS procedural without totally severing its ties with it.

But rules are rules, and the World Cup regulations are there to be followed. And so, a few days before the tournament began, a ballot took place in the USA's hotel, the opulent Marsa Malaz Kempinski in Doha's swanky Pearl district. The vote was cast in a team room specifically set up with ping-pong and pool tables, comfy couches and mood lighting, and a big backdrop that reads: \"One Nation. One Team.\"  On Nov. 17, FOXSports.com broke the news that Adams had been overwhelmingly voted in as captain by his fellow players.  Exactly two Saturdays later, virtually to the minute, the 23-year-old from Poughkeepsie, N.Y. — and now of the English Premier League's Leeds United — will tug on the armband and lead his team out against the Netherlands in the round of 16 at Khalifa International Stadium (10 a.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports app).  This squad will try to pull off what would arguably be the USA's most important World Cup win … ever.", "Nov 22, 2022 ...

Wales striker Gareth Bale had already canceled out Timothy Weah’s first-half strike with a late penalty and was bearing down ominously in search of a last-gasp winner. Despite running tirelessly all match, legs no doubt feeling like lead and lungs pumping acid, Adams emerged from nowhere to steal the ball from the five-time Champions League winner with a precise tackle. It capped an all-action display from the 23-year-old Adams which included winning 83.3% of his attempted tackles, six recoveries and two interceptions, according to stats website FotMob. The Leeds United midfielder pulled the strings in the center of the pitch all match, disrupting Wales with astute positional awareness and feeding his more attack-minded teammates like Weah and Christian Pulisic. That the performance didn’t end with victory likely hurts Adams deeply. “I want to be a winner, I’m very competitive,” Adams said after he was unveiled as Team USA captain on Sunday. “I want to hold the guys around me to the same standard.

He’s already worn the armband nine times during 32 career international appearances. “We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said of the 23-year-old Wappingers Falls, New York native. “He leads by his actions and his words.” FIFA requires teams to name a singular captain for the tournament; the USMNT were the last of 32 Qatar-qualified squads to complete that task. During Berhalter’s tenure, the USMNT have relied on a leadership council and rotating armband responsibilities. Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic and Nashville SC center back Walker Zimmerman were other leading candidates to be named captain. “A lot of credit to my teammates,” Adams said, “because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way.\" Adams debuted for the Red Bulls in 2016 before moving to Europe in the winter of 2019, then to German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

While the agreement included wage increases, schedule flexibility and an additional paid day off, several rail unions had rejected it because it lacked paid sick leave. A move to add seven days of paid sick leave failed in Congress before Mr. Biden signed the bill. The showdown over the rail settlement left Mr. Biden in the awkward position of forcing a deal over the objections of some union members even though he had promised to be the “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.” The pension rescue plan announced on Thursday put him back in the more comfortable stance of allying himself with organized labor, a key constituency of the Democratic Party. The $36 billion, drawn from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last year, will go to the Central States Pension Fund, which is largely made up of Teamster workers and retirees. The fund has been the largest financially distressed multi-employer pension plan in the nation.

Mr. Biden gathered top union leaders at the White House to make the commitment, described by the White House as the largest ever award of federal financial support for worker and retiree pension security. The money, coming from last year’s Covid-19 relief package, will avert cuts of up to 60 percent in pensions for Teamster truck drivers, warehouse workers, construction workers and food processors, mainly in the Midwest. “Thanks to today’s announcement, hundreds of thousands of Americans can feel that sense of dignity again knowing that they’ve provided for their families and their future, and it’s secure,” Mr. Biden said, joined by Sean M.

He assumed the role on March 1, 2023, succeeding Mark Emmert.", "docs": ["Charlie Baker has been NCAA president for less than two weeks, but he knows he is coming into his role in the governing body of major college sports during a tumultuous time.           Baker, most recently the governor of Massachusetts, said his friend Utah Sen. Mitt Romney described the transition from leader of a state to leader of a rule-making organization for student-athletes nationwide as “going from the frying pan and into the fire.”           “I don’t think the people who say it is going through a tumultuous time are exaggerating. I mean, that’s the reason I took the job,” said Baker in his first televised interview since replacing Mark Emmert on March 1. “I could have done a lot of other things that would be a lot easier.”           As NCAA president, Baker will oversee an organization for 520,000 athletes, 19,000 teams and 1,100 schools in three divisions.           On the first day of the men’s basketball tournament, Baker –  who played basketball at Harvard – discussed with CNN’s Chris Wallace the challenges of the job, including rules on transgender athletes; gender equity; how student-athletes can profit from the use of their names, images and likeness (NIL) and transfers.           And he also told CNN why he thinks there’s so much excitement for March Madness.", "Former Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker formally replaces Mark Emmert as the NCAA’s president Wednesday, and during a roughly 30-minute interview with USA TODAY Sports earlier this week, what Baker didn’t say was just as notable as what he did say. Amid what he described as a listening tour of college sports stakeholders that already has been underway and will continue during his first 100 days, Baker did not dismiss out of hand the concept of college athletes becoming employees of their school. He also did not adhere to the idea that the association’s only path to clarifying its most urgent underlying issues is the passage of new federal laws. Those notions have been articles of faith for Emmert and many other college sports leaders as Emmert’s more-than-12-year run with the NCAA has been drawing to a close. His departure also ends an era in which the association has been led on a permanent basis by either a former college president or former college sports administrator. In addition to his background in politics, Baker enters from the worlds of business, healthcare and government administration. He played basketball for Harvard, his wife was a gymnast for Northwestern and his sons played Division III football.   He inherits an association facing pressure on numerous sides regarding the environment surrounding college athletes’ dealings to make money from their name, image and likeness.", "🏈 Ranking the top 25 college football teams 🏆 Preseason FCS bracket projections 📈 HBCU football power rankings 📊 Men's soccer preseason rankings  INDIANAPOLIS — The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) today announced that Charlie Baker, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, will serve as the next NCAA President, assuming the role effective March 2023. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Governor Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as Governor, he brings decades of experience spearheading transformations at high profile institutions in the private and public sectors. Governor Baker’s appointment marks the culmination of a comprehensive and inclusive national search process, led by a subcommittee of the NCAA Board of Governors and TurnkeyZRG, the top search firm in the space (which recently placed the commissioners of the ACC, Pac-12 and Big 12). Baker’s term as Governor ends January 5, 2023. “We are excited to welcome Governor Charlie Baker to the NCAA and eager for him to begin his work with our organization,” said Linda Livingstone, President of Baylor University and Chair of the NCAA Board of Governors, who helmed the presidential search committee. “Governor Baker has shown a remarkable ability to bridge divides and build bipartisan consensus, taking on complex challenges in innovative and effective ways.", "Charlie Baker assumed the duties as the NCAA's sixth president on March 1, 2023.  He was hired for the position on Dec. 15, 2022, as he neared the conclusion of his term as the 72nd governor of Massachusetts. A former collegiate athlete at Harvard, Baker is credited with bringing bipartisan leadership to the state, successfully guiding Massachusetts through an exceptionally turbulent period for government officials. In addition to his two terms as governor, he has brought decades of experience spearheading transformations at high-profile institutions in the private and public sectors. Baker has arrived at the NCAA at a moment of significant transformation. Legal shifts in the environment surrounding college sports have challenged the NCAA's ability to serve as an effective national regulator for college athletics, resulting in an untenable patchwork of individual state laws. Partnering with federal policymakers to develop a consistent, sustainable legal framework to address issues common to student-athletes and athletic departments across the country is a top and immediate priority. A Republican governor serving a predominantly Democratic state, Baker was re-elected to a second term in 2018 with 67 percent of the vote. After eight years in office, he achieved approval ratings exceeding 75 percent, making him the highest-rated governor in the United States and one of the highest-rated elected representatives in the nation. Baker earned widespread support by taking on issues with significant real-world impacts, and approaching them in substantive, innovative and bipartisan ways.", "The NCAA had four major priorities in it search for a new president to look after college athletics. It wanted a former college athlete, an exec passionate about higher education, an established corporate leader and a savvy politician who knows how to get things done in government. The governing body found all of those traits and more in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a former Harvard basketball athlete and avid sports fan. The NCAA announced today that it has selected the two-term governor to be its next president. Baker will replace outgoing NCAA President Mark Emmert starting March 1. His second term as governor is slated to conclude Jan. 5; he announced about a year ago that he wouldn’t seek a third term. Emmert will stay on as an adviser through June. The NCAA’s choice of Baker, 66, signifies the association’s desire to have a leader who is well-versed in the ways that Washington, D.C., works. With the NCAA facing so many legal and legislative challenges, the board of governors, who made the hire, focused on someone from the political arena early in the process and Baker emerged as the candidate with the experience and expertise to navigate the governmental and athletic worlds that often collide in college sports. When asked why he wanted the job, Baker replied, “Because it’s worth doing. Yeah, it’s big and complicated, but so have been a lot of things in my life.“ Baker represents the first NCAA leader who doesn’t have a background in college athletics or higher education."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

An asteroid just spotted for the first time seems to have been circling Earth for decades.  Our planet has a pretty permanent relationship with the moon, but occasionally Earth's gravity can also capture small asteroids that then spend a period of time orbiting us as a sort of temporary satellite. This has happened at least twice this century, with the \"mini moons\" hanging around for just a few years or less, but newly discovered asteroid 2022 YG appears to have been trapped in a bizarre orbit for a number of decades.  The curious space rock was first observed on Dec. 15. Interestingly, one of the first people to spot it was amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov of Crimea, who is also known for discovering the first known interstellar comet, which now bares his name.  Asteroid 2022 YG, as it has initially been cataloged, looks to be between 52 and 98 feet (16 to 30 meters) in diameter. Early computer models of its orbit show that it takes about a year to circle Earth once and that it has been doing so since sometime around 1961.

It was spotted by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, who also previously discovered the first known interstellar comet, according to CNET. 2022 YG was last observed on December 23 at the Steward Observatory on Mount Lemmon, Arizona (via Minor Planet Center). The European Space Agency estimates its next pass near Earth will be around December 22, 2023. Despite having been spotted only recently, 2022 YG has been orbiting Earth since about 1961, according to astronomers' estimates. They guess it may stay in orbit until around 2181, but CNET says astronomers will be doing further research to refine that estimate.  Simulations of 2022 YG's orbital path show that it's unusually shaped: like an elongated oval, stretching out far beyond Earth in two directions but closer to us on its other two sides (via CNET).

Snyder has directed many movies that can be labeled as sci-fi, proof is his long commitment to the DC Universe superheroes in what was nicknamed the “Snyderverse.” However, Space Moon will be his first space opera. The 57-year-old director started his partnership with Netflix with 2021’s Army of the Dead, a zombie movie that featured an epic heist.  Inspired by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and Star Wars, Rebel Moon follows a peaceful colony dealing with an oppressive regent. Still, many details are under wrap, and the movie hasn’t even got a trailer. Yet, Netflix believes so very much in the Rebel Moon potential of the film that a sequel is being filmed back-to-back. Originally, Snyder approached Lucasfilm with his story, but the project never sailed there.

In the Shazam family’s superhero lair within the Rock of Eternity, among the cool stuff is a Mortal Kombat II arcade game. Mortal Kombat was rebooted as a movie franchise by Warner Bros in 2021.

This article contains spoilers for Shazam! Fury of The Gods. Billy Batson learns what it takes to become a hero in Shazam! Fury of The Gods, but does he have a future in the DC comic book universe? One of the credits scenes seems to hope so, but it’s extremely complicated. The first movie was about teen Billy (Asher Angel) unlocking the powers of Shazam — the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury — transforming him into a full-grown superhero (played by Zachary Levi). He learned to control that power, and share it with his siblings. Fury of the Gods is about the responsibility and duty of being a super-powered family that has to protect Philadelphia. Philadelphians are notoriously a tough crowd to win over, and that task is made even more difficult when a trio of super-powered goddesses (Helen Mirren, Lucy Liu, Rachel Zegler) threaten to destroy not only Philly but also all of planet Earth.  What does it mean to be powerful? Where’s the line between personal responsibility and the responsibility owed to people who can’t defend themselves? Why is Helen Mirren so mean in this movie? And why does she get body-slammed so many times?", "It’s not known if Gunn has any plans for Shazam in his DCEU, but if Fury of the Gods achieves a satisfying box-office result, we may not say goodbye to Shazam just yet.  This movie also featured a special cameo from Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot. Gadot is also one of the actors who’s been in DCEU’s good graces, but her future as Wonder Woman also remains unknown. Her third solo movie has been canceled, but that doesn’t mean she is indeed done with playing the role (as we have seen in this movie as well). Shazam! Fury of the Gods continues the story of Billy Batson and his family in a very satisfying way. After this movie, we can’t do anything but want more of Zachary Levi and Asher Angel’s Shazam. We really hope the Shazam family will find their way to Gunn’s DCEU. After all, Gunn’s wife, Jennifer Holland, reprised the role of Emilia Harcourt in the mid-credit scene, so let’s hope Gunn wants to keep Shazam in DCU’s roster.

There has been a sharp increase in news headlines concerning the use of AI art during the past several months. AI has become a contentious topic in the illustration industry since it may one day endanger the employment of professional artists. Digital illustration is only one example of how artificial intelligence is being used in the arts. A lot of AI-generated screenplays and storylines have also been produced, which might endanger authors in the future.   The bizarre brand-new program has been streaming on Twitch since the middle of December of last year. It goes by the name of Nothing, Forever and airs constantly. It is an AI-generated parody of Seinfeld. The blocky, low-resolution visuals are evocative of computer games from the 1980s. Because they are AI, the \"jokes\" are absurd and unpredictable. A month and a half into its run, it went too far on Sunday when its Jerry turned transphobic.

The stream, hosted by a channel called watchmeforever, uses generative artificial intelligence to create an infinite stream of Seinfeld-esque content online. The novel idea has taken root on the platform, and at time of publication, the stream has roughly 15,400 concurrent viewers.  The content comes at a time when generative AI seems to be cropping up everywhere. Here’s what you need to know about AI Seinfeld on Twitch.  AI Seinfeld is a Twitch stream called “Nothing, Forever” that plays AI-generated content based on Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David’s ’90s comedic sitcom, Seinfeld. The show has been formally running since Dec. 14, but the group behind it, Mismatch Media, just started sharing in the past week. It sports a chunky 3D pixel style that looks a video game, and computerized voices that deliver an endless stream of Seinfeld-esque antics.  Skyler Hartle, a member of Mismatch Media, told Polygon that the stream uses various AI software to bring the show to life. The text generation comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3 models and the speech comes from Azure Cognitive Services.", "The surreal Nothing, Forever, streaming 24 hours a day, is an eerie experiment in digital creativity Seinfeld went off the air in 1998, but it’s never really gone away – it’s been the subject of modern recreations, dedicated social media accounts and hip-hop/TV fusions. Its latest incarnation, however, is the oddest yet. Nothing, Forever is an endless, AI-generated version of the show that has been streaming on Twitch since mid-December. It tells the “story” – if you can call it that – of four characters, Larry, Fred, Yvonne and Kakler, who look like what would happen if Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were sucked into a 1990s computer game. They spend their days discussing their lives and other trivial matters. And it never, ever stops: log on at any hour and there they are, talking about coffee quality or a difficult Monopoly game. The dialogue comes from OpenAI’s GPT-3, a text generator closely related to the ChatGPT service that has recently made waves; another company is responsible for the tech behind the speech itself. On top of that, “we have a lot of proprietary generative algorithms that cause the show to be ‘formed’, so to be speak,” Skyler Hartle of Mismatch Media told Polygon. “We collectively call this logic the ‘director’, as it is largely responsible for making sure all the individual pieces come together into a whole.", "Feb 4, 2023 ...

(Photo by John Naughton) Numbers have always been a big part of the Iowa high school sports scene. A new figure entered the playbook last week — $7,598. That’s the voucher amount projected per student in the Students First Act signed into law by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. The concept is families who want to choose a private school education can qualify for a state-sponsored subsidy: “…parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year. The funds are estimated at $7,598 per pupil for the 2023-2024 school year and will be deposited into an education savings account (ESA) to be used for tuition, fees, and other qualified education expenses,” according to a press release from the governor’s office. My question is this: How could this potentially affect sports? I asked two notable Iowa high school activity directors to share their views: Tom Wilson of West Des Moines Dowling Catholic and Aaron Stecker of Cedar Rapids Kennedy. Many of Iowa’s private schools have created successful athletic programs. Wilson has coached eight state champion football teams at Dowling, including a run of seven in a row. Western Christian of Hull is one of the great dynasties in volleyball and boys’ basketball. Waterloo Columbus is a regular title team in girls’ tennis.", "Wills said the bill is meant for families who may want a faith-based education for their children or an academic program not offered at their local schools. He added that the legislation is also Republicans’ response to conservative parents who, in recent years, have claimed that public schools advance a liberal agenda in the way they teach race and history or by holding books in the library some parents find obscene. Gov. Kim Reynolds held a closed meeting last spring with parents from Linn-Mar schools who were upset with a policy that allows students in seventh grade and older to keep their gender support plans private. Wills said that policy is one justification for a vast expansion of state funding for private schools in Iowa. “Why would a parent want to want to choose an Educational Savings Account? Well, maybe they don't trust the public schools anymore,” Wills said. “This is a school refusing to tell parents about their children. Maybe that's why parents choose to go someplace other than public school.” Under the school choice bill, starting next fall, families would be able to apply for Education Savings Accounts, or ESAs, worth $7,598 that they could use to pay for educational expenses such as private school tuition. A fiscal analysis prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimates that, in the first year of the program, 14,068 children would receive Education Savings Accounts, including 4,841 transferring from public to private schools. The program would cost $106.", "Iowa's public schools are the foundation of our education system. For most families, they are the option of choice – and they should be. But public schools aren’t the only choice, and for some families, a different educational path may be better for their children.    Governor Reynolds believes Iowa’s investment in education should support the success of all students, including those whose families choose to enroll them in an accredited private school rather than a public school.     Students First Act signed into law  On January 24, 2023, Governor Reynolds signed the Students First Act into law, just two weeks after introducing it in her annual Condition of the State address. The bill makes state education funding available for K-12 students who choose to attend private schools. It also provides public schools with additional categorical funding for students who live in their district but attend private schools, and allows public school districts to use unspent money from some categorical funds to supplement teacher salaries.  Education Savings Accounts  With the passage of the Students First Act, parents who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year.

With this bill, every child in Iowa, regardless of zip code or income, will have access to the school best suited for them.”  Universal eligibility will be phased in over three years. All incoming Kindergarteners and all public-school students will be eligible beginning year one with the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Eligibility for families of children currently enrolled in accredited private schools will be income based over the first two years.  Parents or guardians who enroll their eligible children in an accredited private school will receive an amount equal to the per pupil funds allocated by the state to all public school districts each year.

Stecker said the key is making athletic programs “unquittable.” Build programs that draw and keep students. Everyone wants to be a winner. So what will the outcome of the legislation be: Private school superpowers or public schools rising to the occasion? Or will the fee factor simply not amount to much when some stars have already treated transfers like a prep portal? “Hopefully, we can make all of our schools as good as we can be,” Wilson said.

What I learned is that Google doesn’t seem to know what Bard is good for, which is one reason it’s releasing Bard slowly as a public “experiment.” Bard doesn’t yet enhance any Google products you already rely on; it lives on its own website, bard.google.com. It’s not a replacement for Google search. It’s not even a replacement for Assistant, Google’s other AI bot, which also answers questions and operates Android phones and smart speakers. And in conversation, Bard can come across as staid — even though it still sometimes struggles with making up facts, bias and sticking to appropriate content like rival chatbots. Oh boy, can it be painfully unfunny. Bard, tell me a joke about Washington and it replies:  “What do you call a Washington, D.C. resident who’s always late? A Washing-ton. This joke is funny because it plays on the word ‘Washington’ and the fact that the city is known for its traffic.", "By          Emily Olson                        Shares for Google's parent company, Alphabet, dropped 9% Wednesday after its AI chatbot, Bard, gave an incorrect answer.

Google's parent company, Alphabet, lost $100 billion in market value on Wednesday after its new artificial intelligence technology produced a factual error in its first demo. It's a bruising reception for Bard, the conversational bot that Google launched as a competitor to Microsoft's headline-making darling, ChatGPT.  In the fateful ad that ran on Google's Twitter feed this week, the company described Bard as \"a launchpad for curiosity\" and a search tool to \"help simplify complex topics.\"  An accompanying GIF prompts Bard with the question, \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?\" The chatbot responds with a few bullet points, including the claim that the telescope took the very first pictures of \"exoplanets,\" or planets outside of earth's solar system.  \"These discoveries can spark a child's imagination about the infinite wonders of the universe,\" Bard says.  Bard is an experimental conversational AI service, powered by LaMDA.", "Once ChatGPT was launched in late 2022, however, Google moved quickly to release a chatbot powered by LaMDA that could compete. Google Bard was first announced in February 2023. After being announced, Google Bard remained open to a limited amount of users, based on a queue in a waitlist. But at Google I/O 2023, the company announced that Bard was now open to everyone, which includes 180 countries and territories around the world. Bard is also now available in Japanese and Korean, with up to 40 languages to be supported soon, according to Google. Bard is still labeled as an “experiment,” but it’s now widely available for anyone to start using. To use Google Bard, just go to bard.google.com. Like all of Google’s products, it’ll require you to log in with your Google account. You’ll also need to agree to the terms of service, but once you click through, you’ll rather quickly be able to start using Google Bard. Like ChatGPT, Bard is mostly just an empty text field, which says “Enter a prompt here.” Type in your prompt or question, and Bard will provide an answer. Helpfully, Google gives a few random ideas to get you started with, which are different each time you open up Bard. The first example I was given was the following: “What’s a fast, balanced, vegetarian meal for me to make? It should be high in protein and fiber.", "Advertisement Supported by The internet giant will grant users access to a chatbot after years of cautious development, chasing splashy debuts from rivals OpenAI and Microsoft. By Nico Grant and Cade Metz Nico Grant and Cade Metz reported this story in San Francisco. For more than three months, Google executives have watched as projects at Microsoft and a San Francisco start-up called OpenAI have stoked the public’s imagination with the potential for artificial intelligence. But on Tuesday, Google tentatively stepped off the sidelines as it released a chatbot called Bard. The new A.I. chatbot will be available to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain and will accommodate additional users, countries and languages over time, Google executives said in an interview. The cautious rollout is the company’s first public effort to address the recent chatbot craze driven by OpenAI and Microsoft, and it is meant to demonstrate that Google is capable of providing similar technology. But Google is taking a much more circumspect approach than its competitors, which have faced criticism that they are proliferating an unpredictable and sometimes untrustworthy technology. Still, the release represents a significant step to stave off a threat to Google’s most lucrative business, its search engine. Many in the tech industry believe that Google — more than any other big tech company — has a lot to lose and to gain from A.I."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products. What is Midjourney’s mission?  We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction. Can you give a brief history of the company to date? We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it’s different from a lot of other stuff. What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society? I’m definitely more concerned about society than business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not.

Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To generate images, users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.[17]  Founder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.[5] Some artists have accused Midjourney of devaluing original creative work by using it in the training set;[18] Midjourney's terms of service includes a DMCA takedown policy, allowing artists to request their work to be removed from the set if they believe copyright infringement to be evident.[19]", "“We’re going from a Midjourney universe to a Midjourney multiverse,” as Holz puts it. And he thinks the results will be incredible: an outpouring of AI-augmented creativity that’s still only the tip of the iceberg.  To find out more about Holz’s ambitions with Midjourney — about why he’s building an “engine for the imagination” and why he thinks AI is more like water than a tiger — we rang him up for an interview.

So, my name is David Holz, and I guess I’m a serial entrepreneur. My brief history would be: I had a design business in high school. I went to college for physics in maths. I was working on a PhD in fluid mechanics while working at NASA and Max Planck. I got overwhelmed at one point and put all those things aside.

This integration allows Bing to respond with written summaries to search queries, enhancing its utility for users seeking detailed information alongside links to relevant websites.", "docs": ["Wong said Google was caught off-guard with the success of ChatGPT but still has the advantage over Microsoft in consumer-facing technology, while Microsoft has the edge in selling its products to businesses. Chinese tech giant Baidu also this week announced a similar search chatbot coming later this year, according to Chinese media. Other tech rivals such as Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have been researching similar technology, but Microsoft’s latest moves aim to position it at the center of the ChatGPT zeitgeist.  Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products like email and spreadsheets. The most surprising might be the integration with Bing, which is the second-place search engine in many markets but has never come close to challenging Google’s dominant position. Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsoft’s earlier search engines and was run for a time by Nadella, years before he took over as CEO. Its significance was boosted when Yahoo and Microsoft signed a deal for Bing to power Yahoo’s search engine, giving Microsoft access to Yahoo’s greater search share. Similar deals infused Bing into the search features for devices made by other companies, though users wouldn’t necessarily know that Microsoft was powering their searches.", "In one demo Bing was asked to “create an itinerary for each day of a 5-day trip to Mexico City.” The question was answered entirely by the chatbot, which described a rough itinerary alongside links to sources for more information.  Unlike ChatGPT, the new Bing can also retrieve news about recent events. In The Verge’s demos, the search engine was even able to answer questions about its own launch, citing stories published by news sites in the last hour.  Microsoft says these features are all powered by an upgraded version of GPT 3.5, the AI OpenAI language model that powers ChatGPT. Microsoft calls this the “Prometheus Model,” and says it’s more powerful than GPT 3.5, and better able to answer search queries with up-to-date information and annotated answers. The new Bing is live today “for desktop limited preview,” but it appears users are only able to “ask” one of a number of preset queries and receive the same results each time. There is also a waitlist to sign up for full access in the future.  In addition to the new Bing, Microsoft is launching two new AI-enhanced features for its Edge browser: “chat” and “compose.” These will be embedded within Edge’s sidebar.", "Microsoft has announced a new version of its search engine Bing, which incorporates the latest in artificial intelligence. The overhaul deploys OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, which has taken the world by storm since its launch last year. The move is by far the biggest threat Google has seen to its dominance in web search - and marks the beginning of an AI arms race between the companies. \"The race starts today,\" Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said.  Developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, ChatGPT uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to search requests. Mr Nadella said he thought it was poised to change the nature of online search - and interactions with many other software.  \"This technology will reshape pretty much every software category that we know,\" he said.  Bing will now respond to search queries with more detailed answers - not just links to websites.  Users are also able to chat with the bot to better tailor their queries. More contextual answers will be added on the right hand side of a search page. The new Bing search engine will be live right away - with a limited number of searches for each person.  The announcement comes a day after Google revealed details of its own new chatbot, Bard. Both companies are scrambling to get their products to market.

I want to share how I came to this decision.    One of my rituals to start every year is writing a list of ideas and aspirations for Pinterest. Some of those ideas turn into new products. Others result in acquisitions. This year, a top priority was identifying new leaders with skills that complement mine.  I held time on my calendar every week to meet executives across a range of industries. Bill stood out.

He added that the company plans to close 5,000 additional open roles that it hasn’t yet filled. In a nod to continued economic uncertainty, Zuckerberg noted that the company should prepare for “the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.” In an SEC filing announcing the cuts, the company also said it anticipated lowered total expenses in 2023, from $86 billion to $92 billion.

According to a document iRobot filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday, it also was the second time Amazon tried to buy the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner and other household robots. The new information reveals more background on how Amazon, which already has a large robotics presence in Massachusetts, scooped up one of the area’s oldest and most influential robotics firms. Amazon first tried to buy iRobot in the fall of 2016, the filing said, but iRobot’s board of directors determined the offer “undervalued” the company at $60.50 per share. In the coming months, iRobot’s stock price increased, and Amazon ended its acquisition discussions. Advertisement The next time Amazon expressed interest in buying iRobot was on May 16 of this year, when an Amazon representative called Colin Angle, cofounder and chief executive of the company. Amazon proposed acquiring iRobot for $64 per share in cash about a month later. Again, iRobot believed Amazon’s offer undervalued the company.

The company hasn't had much success with household robots, but the iRobot acquisition and the company's strong market reputation provide a \"massive foothold in the consumer robot market\" that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a \"race-to-the-bottom\" competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum.

And your season 23 winner of The Voice is… Gina Miles! While all season it seemed like it was Team Blake's trophy to lose, in a real \"the student becomes the master\" situation, first-time coach Niall Horan, Blake Shelton's TV \"son,\" led his indie pop artist to the big win. In what Carson Daly notes was \"the closest margin of victory in Voice history,\" Team Blake's Grace West took the runner-up position, with D.Smooth from Team Kelly, Sorelle from Team Chance, and Team Blake's NOIVAS rounding out third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. Gina Miles showed up to the Blind Auditions a shy teenager with a surprisingly rich voice. She won Niall over with her version of Katy Perry's \"The One That Got Away\" despite her nerves, but really started showing people what she can do in the Battles when she defeated Kala Banham after they duetted on Bon Iver's \"Skinny Love.\" From there, Gina and Niall agreed she should lean into her moody, dark pop side, and she took on Gotye's hit \"Somebody That I Used to Know.", "A shocked Gina Miles reacts as she hears the show declare her the Season 23 winner, with Grace West as the runner-up.

Although it was Blake Shelton’s final season as a coach on the show — and two of the five singers in the finale were from Shelton’s team — the winner wasn’t from Team Blake, which has more wins than any other team in “Voice” history.  Instead, the Season 23 victory went to singer Gina Miles, who was on “Voice” newcomer Niall Horan’s team. Host Carson Daly said it marked the smallest margin of victory in the competition’s history, according to “Entertainment Tonight.”  Standing next to runner-up Grace West, from Shelton’s team, Miles looked visibly shocked when the show called her name and declared her the winner. “It was crazy, I just did not expect that,” Miles told “Entertainment Tonight” after the win. “I’m just so very grateful to be here.”  The 19-year-old singer added that her first order of business is to catch up on sleep, eat and call her father. Horan, meanwhile, said that his relationship with Miles isn’t going to end just because Season 23 of “The Voice” has concluded.   “It’s tough out there.", "A 19-year-old from Sacramento has won the 23rd season of “The Voice,” which bid farewell to longtime coach Blake Shelton during Tuesday’s sentimental finale.

Smooth (Team Kelly) came in third, Sorelle (Team Chance) came in fourth and Noivas (Team Blake) came in fifth place. During her audition, Miles turned the chairs of Horan and Kelly Clarkson with her powerful rendition of Katy Perry‘s “The One That Got Away.” She became involved in music while shadowing her dad, a single parent who performed as a DJ on the weekends.  Television  Iam Tongi, a high school student from Kahuku, Hawaii, won Season 21 of ‘American Idol’ following an impressive run dedicated to his late father.   “I love voices with so much character like you’ve got,” Horan told Miles during her tryout. “It was incredible to see you get up there and really hit those notes with proper control. ...

Musk is listed as the director of the company and Jared Birchall, widely considered to be Musk’s right-hand man behind the scenes, is listed as the company’s secretary. Musk publicly called for a six-month pause in the development of artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but that hasn’t stopped Musk from going full steam ahead in developing his own AI. Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015 but left the company after a power struggle in 2018. Musk has made some big hires from the world of artificial intelligence lately, including Igor Babuschkin and Manuel Kroiss, according to a reporter earlier this week from Insider. Babuschkin was hired away from DeepMind, the AI arm of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

Technically, Twitter Inc.", "Elon Musk wants to “understand the true nature of the universe.” At least that’s what his new AI company, xAI, said on its website as he announced its formation on Wednesday. Musk incorporated xAI in Nevada in March this year and reportedly purchased “roughly 10,000 graphics processing units”—hardware that is required to develop and run state-of-the-art AI systems. The company has not said how it is financed but the Financial Times reported in April that Musk was discussing getting funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla, two companies he runs. The company has not shared much detail about its intentions, but said on its website that its team would be joining a Twitter Spaces call on July 14 to take questions. (Musk is the owner of Twitter.) The AI company will work closely with Twitter, now called X Corp., and Tesla, as well as other companies “to make progress towards our mission,” xAI said on its website.    The team at xAI, led by Musk, includes former employees of prominent AI companies OpenAI and DeepMind, as well as Microsoft and Tesla.

The filing, dated March 9, lists Musk as the company’s sole director and Jared Birchall, who manages Musk’s family office, as its secretary. Musk has been publicly skeptical of the future of artificial intelligence in the past and has even called for a complete AI development pause, citing “risks to society” he says the technology poses. “Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control,” a group of tech experts including Musk said in an open letter calling for the development pause last month. In an interview with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson that will air next week, Musk warned that “AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production.”  “In the sense that it has the potential — however small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivial — it has the potential of civilization destruction,” he said. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence firms, but left the company in 2018 after a reported internal power struggle.

Musk even reportedly sought funding from SpaceX and Tesla investors to get the company started. During an interview on Twitter Spaces, when Musk was asked about all the GPUs he purchased, the billionaire made no mention of his plans to build an AI company, stating “it seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point.” The purported X.AI name matches the branding of the X Corp. name he has since assigned to Twitter, along with the “X” label he’s applied to his vision of an “everything app."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

(April 19, 2023) – The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) today announced that Rebecka Peterson, a high school math teacher, is the 2023 National Teacher of the Year. Peterson has taught high school math classes ranging from intermediate algebra to Advanced Placement calculus for 11 years at Union High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A proud immigrant of Swedish-Iranian descent, Peterson is passionate about making mathematics engaging, relevant and accessible to all students, no matter their background.  Amid a difficult first year of high school teaching, she found “One Good Thing,” a collaborative blog for teachers to track the good things happening in their classrooms. She credits daily posting there to helping her recognize the beautiful and positive experiences occurring in her classroom, which inspired her to stay in the profession. She has since contributed 1,400 posts to the blog. As Oklahoma Teacher of the Year, she has visited teachers across the state to highlight their important work through the Teachers of Oklahoma campaign.", "Get tickets now for the 2023 Best Places to Work program   By: Journal Record Staff//April 20, 2023 National Teacher of the Year Rebecka Peterson of Tulsa is interviewed Wednesday on “CBS Mornings.\"   (Screenshot from CBS) Oklahoma’s Rebecka Peterson named 2023 National Teacher of the Year National Teacher of the Year Rebecka Peterson of Tulsa is interviewed Wednesday on “CBS Mornings.\"   (Screenshot from CBS)   By: Journal Record Staff//April 20, 2023 Rebecka Peterson, a math teacher at Union High School in Tulsa, is the 2023 National Teacher of the Year.

Oklahoma is lucky to have her, and we are happy to share her talents with teachers and students across the country.” Peterson is expected to serve as an ambassador for education for a year and advocate for students and teachers. “The best teachers understand how their roles are not just about contributing to an excellent education, but also to their community.", "“I am proud CCSSO has had the privilege to support excellent teachers like Rebecka through the National Teacher of the Year Program for more than 70 years.”  Every year, exemplary teachers from each state, U.S. extra-state territories, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity are selected as State Teachers of the Year. From that group, the National Teacher of the Year is chosen by a selection committee composed of 17 individuals and education organizations. The Selection Committee said in a statement: “Rebecka is a caring and passionate educator who understands the importance of connections and providing individual supports for students, both in her math classes and beyond. She has a deep knowledge of both education policy and teaching practices and understands that sustained change at a small scale can make a big difference for students. We know people across the country will connect with the stories she shares as the 2023 National Teacher of the Year.”    “Rebecka Peterson has inspired our children in the classroom — but we all know that her work is not done yet, and she will inspire millions of others in her very young but distinct career. Rebecka has changed the lives of countless students; she impacts all those around her and makes everyone better. She finds potential not only in our children, but in our teachers as well,” Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters said. “She represents Oklahoma’s future and reassures us all that the future is bright."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

He received a total of $6.3 million in compensation in 2021, when he didn’t receive the grant, and his salary has remained steady at $2 million the past three years.

We hate it here. \"There's some amount of mental work and barrier to thinking of how to compose a message,\" Coyne Lloyd, a 35-year-old tech investor and Rizz user, told The Washington Post. \"It's like getting started on a term paper.\" And Rizz isn't the only app like this out there. As WaPo notes, a few other apps, including one called YourMove.ai, are currently on the market, while a number of dating app scoundrels have taken to the internet in recent months to tout the supposed dating app prowess of ChatGPT. \"This past summer, I got really tired of sifting through and trying to come up with responses on dating apps,\" YourMove.ai founder Dmitri Mirakyan told WaPo. \"So I tried to see if GPT3 could flirt.

Those users have generated 2.5 million openers and replies. “The demand is strong because a lot of users don’t know how to open up on dating apps,” said Khaves. Zhang said that one of the biggest challenges has been trying to decipher inputs from users who aren’t used to writing proper AI prompts. This is perhaps why Rizz gave Lloyd such nonsensical answers. In one instance, a woman presented a humorous date idea on Hinge with the phrase “Steal the Declaration of Independence.” Rizz’s AI tool generated the response, “As much as I’d like to see the Declaration of Independence, I think that’s a little excessive.” Another woman’s profile said she knew the best spot in town for birria tacos.

That lack of personalization is part of what ultimately caused Lloyd, the investor, to lose faith in the AI dating tool. Throughout his experience using Rizz, the AI constructed a slew of strange and often outright false messages. “You can imagine a world where Tinder and Hinge have all your chats and offer up the type of thing you’d say in a scenario that’s authentic to your voice,” he said.

The company behind it is just one of many start-ups trying to transform romance through artificial intelligence by optimizing and automating online dating, now one of the primary ways by which people find romantic connections. Using dating apps can be a slog. Some people complain that they have to sift through countless matches as others indiscriminately swipe; it is difficult to start conversations with strangers; and many users end up viewing the apps more as a necessary chore than an exciting opportunity to connect with someone new.

MANZOOR: You know, it's been the women who've uplifted me the most in my life, but who've also cut me down the hardest. There's something about the pain of a woman critiquing another woman that hurts more when - than when a man does it. CHANG: Yeah. MANZOOR: Like, you're part of - you should be on my team. It just cuts deep on a whole other level. And so for me, I'm most interested of seeing women - you know, the matriarch who upholds the patriarchy. And, you know, it's so exciting as well to explore, like, as you say, a female villain. The dark feminine is so beautiful because it's something that we have had to quash. We've had to deny. Getting to show the light and the dark sitting together was really so exciting for me. CHANG: Nida Manzoor directed the new film, \"Polite Society.\" Thank you so much for sharing this time with us. I so enjoyed this. MANZOOR: Oh, thank you, Ailsa. It was so much fun to chat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2023 NPR.", "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter A Letter From Filmmaker Nida Manzoor About Polite Society  The writer-director offers an inside look at her new action-comedy Sundance feature Share on Facebook Share on Twitter This started for me about 10 years ago when I had the idea to make the film. I wrote the first draft when I was in my early 20s, and I was just trying to get it made. It was only in the last couple years that we've found the right partners to make it with. So it's been a long road, but I got to make the feature film of my dreams. I feel like I'm kind of the most ready I've ever been to make it.  Actor Priya Kansara and director Nida Manzoor on the set of Polite Society. I knew I wanted to make a film that was about two sisters, that really foregrounds this sisterly love story, because I don't think we get to see that a lot in films, especially not with action and dance numbers. It was drawn a lot from my own relationship with my sister, such a close, intimate, and loving relationship. But then, when you fight with your siblings, that kind of fighting can be the most brutal.  It's important to me to show a South Asian family [the way I did], because it's sort of been my experience."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Launched at Wednesday’s Google I/O conference, the Pixel Fold is Google’s first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its 2022 flagship phone’s features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.  The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Google’s most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsung’s latest Galaxy Z Fold 4 and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables — with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC — having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.", "Photos viewed by CNBC show that the phone will open like a book to reveal a small tablet-sized 7.6-inch screen, the same size as the display on Samsung's competitor. It weighs 10oz, slightly heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, but it has a larger battery that Google says will last for 24 hours, or up to 72 hours in a low power mode. The Pixel Fold is powered by Google's Tensor G2 chip, according to the documents. That's the same processor that launched in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro phones last year. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. While hardware is a small fraction of Google’s revenue, the Pixel Fold is the most expensive phone in the company's Google Pixel family. Google has been working on the software, including Android and its app store Google Play, for third-party devices made by companies like Samsung, the current folding phone market leader. The Pixel Fold will give Google a chance to show what a fully Google-made foldable phone experience is like.

IDC estimates shipments will more than triple from 2022, to roughly 50 million units annually, by 2027. That would still be under 4% of the market, but would account for a $42 billion slice because they fetch higher prices. “Foldables are a pricing dream,” said Neil Mawston, director of research at Strategy Analytics. “We predict foldables will account for an outsized 5% of all smartphone wholesale revenues worldwide this year.” In a presentation, Google said that its foldable’s distinguishing features are its screen technology and cameras. The company has built a library of AI-powered camera features — such as its Magic Eraser, which can remove unwanted elements in photos for a neater composition — that it says make its hardware a leader. Still, Samsung’s comparable foldable device has slightly better image sensor specifications. Foldable phones typically have an external display for quick tasks and can fold open to a tablet-sized interior screen.

And thankfully, the company’s first attempt at a folding phone feels very different from the others you can buy right now. For one, this book-style foldable isn’t as awkward to use as some models. The Fold has a 5.8-inch external screen, and it’s proportions are pretty close to traditional smartphone screens. Rival models from Samsung, for example, have taller and slimmer displays on the outside, so sending text messages and browsing the web can feel a little awkward. Thankfully, that’s not the case here.

The Copilot, powered by GPT-4 from OpenAI, will sit alongside Microsoft 365 apps much like an assistant (remember Clippy?), appearing in the sidebar as a chatbot that allows Office users to summon it to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, or even help use features like PivotTables in Excel. Microsoft’s Copilot leaked earlier today. “It works alongside you, embedded in the apps millions of people use everyday: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more,” said Microsoft 365 head Jared Spataro. “Copilot is a whole new way of working.” Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects, organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Copilot can also be summoned throughout Microsoft’s Office apps and be used in Word to draft documents based on other files.

Business Chat works across all your business data and apps to surface the information and insights you need from a sea of data — so knowledge flows freely across the organization, saving you valuable time searching for answers. You will be able to access Business Chat from Microsoft 365.com, from Bing when you’re signed in with your work account, or from Teams.

He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google’s latest Photos trick is a feature it’s calling Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to let you make major edits to a photo without professional tools. The company revealed the feature at Google I/O 2023. Google shared a couple examples of Magic Editor in action that are both pretty cool. In one, a photo of a person in front of a waterfall, Google entirely moves the person further to the side of the photo, erases people in the background, and makes the sky a prettier blue. Watch this GIF to see it all happen: In another photo, Magic Editor scoots a child on a bench closer to the middle of the photo, which generates “new” parts of the bench and balloons to the left to fill in the space. In this example, Google again makes the sky more vibrant. Check it out in this GIF: It’s impressive stuff — and a logical next step from photo features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser. It’s also not quite perfect given leftover artifacts like creases from the bag strap in the waterfall photo and a misplaced shadow under the bench in the second.", "May 10, 2023 ...

Using Magic Editor, you’ll also be able to create new content to fill in the gaps after repositioning your subject. Take this picture of a boy on his birthday. It’s a good photo but it could be better if he was front and center. With the power of generative AI, you can create more of the bench and balloons to fill in those gaps, and they’ll blend seamlessly into your photo. The end result? A stunning shot that captures the feeling of his big day. We plan to give select Pixel phones early access to Magic Editor later this year. While this new, experimental technology will open up exciting editing possibilities, we know there might be times when the result isn’t exactly what you imagined. Your feedback will be important in helping us improve it over time so you can get the best edits possible. Over the past few years, AI has simplified complex photo editing tasks, allowing you to easily enhance your memories and get creative with your editing.

Call me some type of weird photo purist, but I’m not a fan of editing a photo in a way that would alter my memory of an event. If I was taking a picture of a wedding and the sky was cloudy, I wouldn’t think about swapping it for something better. Maybe — just maybe — I might consider moving things around or amping up the sky on a picture I’m posting to social media, but even that seems a little disingenuous. But, again, that’s just me. I could still see plenty of people using the Magic Editor to perfect their photos for social media, which adds to the larger conversation of what exactly we should consider a photo and whether or not that’s something people should be obligated to disclose. Google calls its Magic Editor “experimental technology” that will become available to “select” Pixel phones later this year before rolling out to everyone else.

A presenter onstage tapped on the woman, picked her up, and moved her to the other side of the image, with the app automatically filling in the space where she once stood. They then tapped on the overcast sky, and it instantly bloomed into a brighter cloudless blue. In just a matter of seconds, the image had been transformed. The AI-powered tool, dubbed the Magic Editor, certainly lived up to its name during the demo. It’s the kind of tool that Google has been building toward for years. It already has a couple of AI-powered image editing features in its arsenal, including the Magic Eraser, which lets you quickly remove people or objects from the background of an image. But this type of tool takes things up a notch by letting you alter the contents — and potentially, the meaning — of a photo in much more significant ways.

But as noted, pretty much all of the same can be done in a Meta Quest VR unit already, with the addition of full VR, which the Vision Pro doesn’t have. And for a lot cheaper. At launch, coming early next year, the Vision Pro will be priced at a whopping $3,499. For comparison, the new Quest 3 unit, coming this fall, will be $499. Yeah, not sure Apple has cracked the unit pricing aspect as yet.  Of course, things might be different if the Vision Pro was something that you could wear outside the house, if Apple had been able to integrate full AR and pass-through capability into stylish glasses, like Meta’s Stories collaboration with Ray Ban. But look at this: Like, the technology seems solid, the functionality is interesting.", "Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset.  Apple Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499 and it is set to launch in early 2024. It will be available on Apple.com when it launches, and in stores only in the United States to begin with.

Apple Vision Pro is a \"mixed reality\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings.   Apple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment.  With this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \"anywhere\" with just the Vision Pro.", "By  Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t seem fazed by Apple’s introduction of the Vision Pro.  In a companywide meeting with Meta employees today that The Verge watched, the CEO said Apple’s device didn’t present any major breakthroughs in technology that Meta hadn’t “already explored” and that its vision for how people will use the device is “not the one that I want.” He also pointed to the fact that Meta’s upcoming Quest 3 headset will be much cheaper, at $499 compared to the Vision Pro’s $3,499 price tag, giving Meta the opening to reach a wider user base. “I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this in a way that I think is really important,” Zuckerberg told employees, who were gathered at the company’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters for its first all-hands meeting since 2020. Zuckerberg said that the Quest is about “people interacting in new ways and feeling closer” while also “about being active and doing things.” “I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this” “By contrast, every demo that they showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself,” he said of Apple’s WWDC keynote earlier this week.", "By  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Apple has announced an augmented reality headset called Apple Vision Pro that “seamlessly” blends the real and digital world. “It’s the first Apple product you look through, and not at,” CEO Tim Cook said of the device, which looks like a pair of ski goggles. As rumored, it features a separate battery pack and is controlled with eyes, hands, and voice. It will start at $3,499 and launch early next year, starting in the US market with more countries coming later in the year. Vision Pro is positioned as primarily an AR device, but it can switch between augmented and full virtual reality using a dial.  The device is controller-free, and you browse rows of app icons in an operating system called visionOS by looking at them. You can tap to select and flick to scroll, you can also give voice commands, and Apple says “hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps” will automatically work that way. On top of that, the headset supports Bluetooth accessories, including Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and lets you connect your Mac to use inside the headset. Downward-facing cameras can capture your hands even if they’re resting low on your body."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Apple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, with the device introduced at WWDC 2023 in June. A launch is set for early 2024, which means January to late April. While the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world.  Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements.  For a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \"real\" and the \"immersive\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown.", "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple's first mixed reality headset is finally here and it's not cheap The Apple Vision Pro is Apple's first official mixed reality headset. And you can see our first impressions in our Apple Vision Pro hands-on review.  And let's be clear — when we say mixed reality, we mean it. While the headset may look like a contender for the best VR headset on the market, it is not designed to keep you immersed in a virtual world. Features such as EyeSight and Digital Persona ensure that not only are you still engaged with the physical world, but the physical world remains able to engage with you. But, of course, these groundbreaking features come with an earth-shattering price. At $3,499, the Apple Vision Pro is easily the most expensive mainstream headset — virtual reality or mixed reality. And unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while to get your hands on it, since Apple says it won't be available until 2024. Here's everything we know about the Apple Vision Pro.   According to Apple's launch presentation during the WWDC keynote, the Vision Pro will cost $3,499 at launch. The headset will initially be available in the U.S. only, so we do not have pricing for other countries at this time. Interestingly, one leaker claims Apple only spends $1,509 for each headset it builds.", "The headset features 12 cameras, six microphones and five sensors to allow for eye tracking, hand tracking and voice commands to be all you need to control the device. Then inside the headset is a ring of LED lights that project invisible patterns onto your eyes to assist with the eye-tracking. These LED lights also power Optic ID, which is the Vision Pro's version of Face ID. Under the hood, the Vision Pro is powered entirely by Apple silicon. An M2 chip does most of the heavy lifting, but a brand-new R1 chip handles the sensor inputs and ensures the display doesn't lag behind. Apple says the R1 chip keeps the input lag of the twin 4K Micro OLED displays at just around 12ms — on par with a lot of the best TVs. Finally, Apple promises spatial audio thanks to a speaker on each side of the headset, near where it connects with your Head Band. These speakers — or audio pods — provide what Apple calls \"the most advanced Spatial Audio system ever.\" The individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod can even be fine-tuned to deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on your head and ears. And it's not only the Apple Vision Pro spec sheet that matters here. Apple wants to insert the Vision Pro into its greater ecosystem of devices, so it's potentially upgrading the ultrawide-band chip in the iPhone 15 to a 7nm chip for greater power efficiency when used in concert with the Vision Pro.", "Vision Pro is Apple's wearable \"spatial computing\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset with similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.   Design wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \"three-dimensionally formed.\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands.  The frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes.   At the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric strap that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit.", "CUPERTINO, California, June 5 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) on Monday unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro in its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O). At its annual developer conference, Apple also introduced a raft of new products and features, including a 15-inch MacBook Air, a powerful chip called M2 Ultra, improvements to its iOS software and a long-awaited tweak to prevent its autocorrect from annoyingly changing a common expletive to \"ducking\". The Vision Pro will start at $3,499, more than three times the cost of the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that have yet to gain traction with consumers and put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. Apple emphasized the novelty of the headset's augmented reality features as well as the sports and entertainment partnerships it would offer. The device will use a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye, Apple said. But the announcements failed to excite Wall Street, which had bid up Apple shares to a record high ahead of the launch. The stock was largely flat in post-market trading."], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}

Maven, which was founded in 2014 when telemedicine was first starting to take off, aspires to solve both of these problems, helping millions find support in areas like fertility, pregnancy, adoption, parenting, and pediatrics. Maven founder and CEO Kate Ryder joined Scarlet Fu, Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg QuickTake host, for an online talk on Thursday, September 30, as part of the Cornell Tech @ Bloomberg Speaker Series. She shared the story of her career transition from journalism to venture capitalist to entrepreneurship, the birth of her startup, and the lessons she’s learned on the road to building a company valued at more than $1 billion. Ryder is a born storyteller, having begun her career as a journalist, writing about finance and business. One of her earliest breaks was ghostwriting the memoir of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, which dealt with Paulson’s experience during the financial crisis of 2008. “So much about entrepreneurship is figuring out the signal in the noise,” says Ryder, comparing her recent career as a CEO to her start in journalism.

And so, you know, you think about it, about 40% of new moms are dropping out of the workforce after they have kids, and the entire LGBTQ community has been left out of the family-building model, because there weren’t benefits for things like IVF for adoption or surrogacy. We have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world, and we’re also the richest country that spends the most on health care.

In front of him was Rory McIlroy, one of golf’s biggest talents who looked ready to end his perplexing nine-year drought in the majors. Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother — “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage.

Kupp joins 49ers great Joe Montana (1989) as the only players to win AP Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP in the same season.", "📺: #SBLVI on NBC 📱: https://t.co/K02y40b5Nu pic.twitter.com/vhHjVNRsnC MORE: Cooper Kupp stats: Where does Rams receiver's historic season rank in NFL history Kupp was also instrumental in the Rams' final go-ahead drive: He converted fourth-and-1 at the Rams' 37 with a 7-yard end-around and also caught three passes for 38 yards prior to his game-winning catch. That doesn't include a 4-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone that was nullified by offsetting penalties (holding on the Rams and unnecessary roughness on the Bengals). \"I don’t feel deserving of this … I don’t know what to say.”  — L.A.

Donald was similarly impactful on the defensive side of the ball, registering four tackles (two for loss), two sacks and three quarterback hits — including the one that forced an incompletion by Joe Burrow on fourth-and-1, sealing the victory for Los Angeles.", "By Eric D. WilliamsFOX Sports NFL Writer The Los Angeles Rams were down a big-time playmaker, with an injured Odell Beckham Jr. watching in street clothes from the sideline. It didn’t matter. Los Angeles' do-everything receiver, Cooper Kupp, once again stepped up during the critical stretch of the game. The Eastern Washington product scored the go-ahead touchdown on a leaping, 1-yard catch on a back-shoulder fade from Matthew Stafford with 1:25 left in the game. Aaron Donald and L.A.’s defense held up, and the Rams took home a 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium. Kupp finished with eight receptions for 92 receiving yards and two scores. For his effort, he earned Super Bowl MVP honors.  \"That game today is the story of our season,\" Stafford said. \"It’s up and down. It’s tough. And we’re a frickin’ tough team. We showed up late and got it done. I’m excited.\"  Down 20-16 with a little more than six minutes left and the Bengals in control, the Rams needed to march the length of the field for a score. And they had to do so while shorthanded on offense.  Beckham was on his way to another solid outing, posting two receptions for 52 yards, including a 17-yard catch for the first touchdown of the game.", "So it was that Kupp hauled in the game-winning 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford with 1:25 left and became the eighth wide receiver to win Super Bowl MVP -- and the first since Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII. Kupp, who was 7-1 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook, finished with eight catches for 92 yards and two scores. The second touchdown capped a drive in which Kupp, with the help of Stafford and some savvy tweaks from Rams coach Sean McVay, took over the game. After a quick start, Kupp, who also won the NFL's receiving triple crown by leading the league in receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns, didn't get the ball much. Fellow wideout Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a left knee injury with 3:50 remaining in the first half, and with Beckham out of the game, the Bengals threw everything they had at slowing Kupp.  \"Whatever it is, I just want to execute my job to the best of my ability,\" Kupp said. \"I trust that as the game goes on, I will have opportunities, as well, and I just want to stay ready for those things, stay locked in.\" In their first season as teammates, Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp connected for 22 TDs, including the playoffs. It was the second most by a QB-receiver duo in a season in NFL history.", "Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  Fittingly, Super Bowl LVI was won by the NFL's most prolific offensive player.
