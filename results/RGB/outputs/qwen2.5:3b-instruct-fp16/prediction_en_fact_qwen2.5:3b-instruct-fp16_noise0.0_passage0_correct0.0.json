The company has explored the space with some projects and investments, such as acquiring Nreal for its AR technology expertise.\n\nOne notable project is Project Aether, which was a collaboration between Microsoft Research and HoloLens developers to create augmented reality headsets that would allow users to control digital objects using eye movements or gestures. However, this does not mean an official consumer product has been released by Microsoft as of my last update in October 2023.\n\nMicrosoft did unveil the Hololens 3 headset in July 2023, which is a mixed reality (MR) device combining AR and VR capabilities. This is more advanced than traditional AR systems but still falls under the broader category of MR technology rather than pure AR.\n\nIf you are interested in Microsoft's involvement with AR research or any future plans related to consumer AR headsets, it would be best to check their official announcements and updates for the most recent information.", "docs": [], "noise_rate": 0.0, "factlabel": 0}
